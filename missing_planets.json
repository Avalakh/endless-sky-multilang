"Aava-Aasa-Khora",
"This planet is the collective seat of what are known as the Old Houses, the noble families who held territorial claims to this region of space before the collapse of the Predecessors' empire and the arrival of the so-called New Houses fleeing their crumbling society."
],
[
"Ablub's Invention",
"This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts."
],
[
"Aera",
"Aera is a large tidally locked ice giant close to its parent star. Its methane atmosphere is dominated by a titanic hurricane covering the dayside half of the planet, the result of tidal forces drawing streams of air and clouds into a planet-sized storm. The eye of the hurricane is surprisingly calm, but the heat of perpetual daylight drives temperatures higher than what is habitable for most life."
],
[
"Aetuah",
"The close proximity of Aetuah and the neighboring ice moon causes various ebbs and flows in the storms on the gas giant as well as constant reshaping of the moon's surface. The ice moon may have been captured by Aetuah in times past as a rogue planet, and the distance of the gas giant from the system center suggests it might be a rogue planet itself as well. In time, the gravitational force exhibited by Aetuah will tear apart the ice moon, plummeting it into the abyss."
],
[
"Aksaray",
"At first glance, Aksaray appears to be a fairly generic moon formed from eons of dust and debris compressed into a tight ball by constant gravitational pressure. What is not commonplace is the presence of almost perfectly pyramidal piles of regolith scattered across the world. Querying an orbiting Remnant satellite suggests that these are believed to have been remote mining sites for mineral processing."
],
[
"Aktina Cylinder",
"The Aktina Cylinder is an incomplete space station of an enormous scale. Two dozen kilometers in diameter and three times that in length, when complete it will be able to house tens of millions of Avgi in urban conditions. Thousands of cylinders like these were built over the years in the Avgi core systems, but limited resources have constrained the Avgi in the Tangled Shroud to only building one over the last decade."
],
[
"Alathil",
"Eons later, Alathil still resonates with the shocks of the supernova that reshaped the Tap system. The entire atmosphere is still in turmoil, with layers of gas upturned upon themselves. These exposed layers are the source of Alathil's vibrant coloring, which is both beautiful and deadly."
],
[
"Alix",
"Alix is a small moon of the gas giant Pathera, lacking a breathable atmosphere but rich in minerals. While settlements on the moon have been destroyed to the extent that all that remains are debris scattered across the terrain, some automated facilities are still functioning and see a constant flow of cargo drones that stop by the moon to gather raw materials before quickly bringing them to the nearby station's reserves."
],
[
"Alonis Observatory",
"Decades ago, this large observatory station was constructed in order to peer into the anomalous region known as the Ember Waste. Before the Avgi were able to harden their ships against the prevalent ion storms, this was their only way to extract its secrets. An array of advanced telescopes covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum sits side by side with more exotic equipment, from gravitational wave interferometers to neutrino detectors."
],
[
"Alta Hai",
"This is a complete Quarg ringworld, the product of millennia of construction effort which has consumed every other stellar object in this system in order to provide the raw materials. The inner edge of the ring is filled with solar panels, hydroponic gardens, living quarters, and sunlit common spaces. The outer edge contains hangars and docks for ships, and storage facilities for cargo."

[
"Alvorada",
"Formerly \"Fortaleza da Alvorada,\" Alvorada was hollowed out centuries ago to make an extensive network of bunker complexes that used to house the Politburo of the CCOR and the extensive computer system they built that administered their centrally-planned economy. Rumor has it that, in the deepest reaches of the complex where no pirates have yet been able to breach, they're still there, having adapted the system to instead direct the guerrillas in the reestablishment of their homeland."
],
[
"Amathil",
"As far as desert worlds come, Amathil is merely dry and sandy, with a mild surface temperature that is surprisingly uniform across latitudes thanks to high altitude winds. While unattractive for settlement due to the scarcity of greenery, Amathil is still home to the descendents of those who arrived on the first few sublight starships, back when little was known about the planet besides that it had an oxygenated atmosphere. The unique culture that has since grown here, under a unified planetary government, emphasizes a sense of community and generosity - or at least that is how the locals like to be perceived by outsiders."
],
[
"Anatrefo",
"Anatrefo was discovered mere years after the Avgi discovered the hyperdrive, and was soon considered the most momentous discovery in Avgi history. An intact alien station, albeit one stripped of any advanced technologies, proved once and for all that the Avgi were not alone in the universe. Even more significant was a long, slender megastructure near the station, appearing as though construction on it had barely been started."
],
[
"Angko",
"Angko is a massive industrial world, with most cities on its surface supporting vast manufacturing sectors, factories, and warehouses. The level of industrial progress has not gone without its environmental impacts, however. At some time in the planet's past, the ice caps melted, causing sea levels to rise globally. The Bunrodeans have since moved to less environmentally negative practices, but the damage was already done, and the planet hasn't been the same since."
],
[
"Anitlos",
"The surface of Anitlos, the largest moon of Oura, is a smooth landscape of ice pierced by rocky, metallic protrusions. These surface metal deposits, brought by a late asteroid bombardment a few hundred million years ago, served as one of the best sources of material for the cylinder habitats that clustered around Oura, its moons, and its Lagrange points."
],
[
"Antamesa",
"The planet's tempest winds thrum beneath vibrant emerald and velvet auroras that flare like curtains aflame. Derelict stations sprawl across its skies, a single flank of each bristling with empty missile tubes. A handful remain semi-intact, casting warm, rosy halos against the swirling clouds, launchers still baring skyward at forgotten foes."
],
[
"Antivli Station",
"Once one of many, this was an enormous synchrotron particle accelerator several kilometers in diameter, dedicated towards the industrial production of large quantities of antimatter. With beamed power provided by the thousands of solar collection satellites around Anax, enough antimatter could be produced each year to supply both Avgi research and industrial efforts. The discovery of the hyperdrive nearly wiped the antimatter economy out overnight, with interstellar travel now almost trivial."
],
[
"Aqra-Kvel-Taaq",
"While this planet may have a rocky surface deep down, it is covered by kilometers-thick glaciers composed of water ice. Near the equator, a ring of craters push the ice up into circular ridges that cast long shadows across the landscape."
],
[
"Arachne Station",
"Arachne Station is privately owned by Tarazed Corporation, and there are no services available here for people who are not Tarazed employees."
],
[
"Araio",
"Araio is a relatively small world dominated by a single supercontinent. Continental uplift has made much of the land characterized by mountainous highland, scattered with numerous springs and lakes. Though the air is thin and the soil is rocky, hardy plants and woody trees cling to life, breaking up the landscape of rocky mountains with colorful meadows and bountiful forests."
],
[
"Aresepru Nat",
"Now that the Korath are gone, the oceans on this planet have begun to teem with fish and other living creatures once again, and the levels of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide are slowly swinging back into balance. Species of algae and bacteria that are able to metabolize the plastics and chemicals that the Korath left behind have spread throughout the oceans."
],
[
"Arroharg",
"Arroharg is a low-gravity moon that the Quarg have converted to some sort of harvesting grounds. Massive machines that dwarf your ship seem to be displacing mountainous formations while smaller ones collect from the zones left behind. Most of the architecture here is Quarg-like and is not designed in a way that welcomes visitors very comfortably. The lower levels of the outpost seem to dig deeper into the surface of the moon, but the farther they go down, the more complex they become. There's no telling how deep into the moon they go, as they are restricted to everyone but the Quarg."
],
[
"Asgard",
"Asgard was one of the first worlds to be settled in the Deep. It is now home to many crowded cities, with soaring skyscrapers that are made of lightweight composite materials rather than the steel and concrete so commonly used elsewhere."
],
[
"Ashkelon",
"An otherwise mundane rocky world, Ashkelon is littered with thousands of basalt monoliths. Most are cracked, many others reduced to rubble, and a scant few are intact enough for the deep carvings that cover their surface to be read. These glyphs were seemingly designed to be easily translated, which Avgi researchers quickly did. There was much excitement when it was realized that the monoliths contained instructions and advice on various technologies, but this quickly turned to disappointment when a years-long survey revealed that no monolith had information on anything more advanced than the steam engine."
],
[
"Ashy Reach",
"The thin, unbreathable atmosphere and low gravity mean that Ashy Reach will never become popular as a residential world, but it serves a useful role as a hub for shipping and commercial exchange. There is only one settlement here, built around the spaceport, and consisting mostly of pressurized underground caverns. Outside the settlement, the planet's surface is drab and almost lifeless."
],
[
"Aspar",
"A rarity in the Tangled Shroud, Aspar is a habitable moon with a temperate climate and a thriving ecosystem. Widespread settlement has been prevented, however, due to the unfortunate fact that life on Aspar uses proteins with the opposite chirality to those used by life on Earth and Aviskir."
],
[
"Asphodel",
"Despite being nominally in the habitable zone, this planet's surface is continually scorched by the stars of Gacrux and their solar flares, steadily blasting away its atmosphere. A joint venture of three major universities from Chiron has placed some small research stations in orbit around Asphodel, and while they provide valuable insights into the nature and behavior of flare stars, the researchers generally avoid descending to the planet's surface unnecessarily. None of the stations appear to have the facilities to service your ship, however."
],
[
"Asterus",
"The seas beneath the frozen surface of this ice moon are home to a thriving ecosystem full of species entirely unlike any observed on other, more habitable worlds. The best known of these is a species of large fish-like creatures with flowing bioluminescent fins that glow in ethereal pinks and purples, the beauty of which prompted many citizens of the Paradise Worlds to demand that Parliament designate the entire moon as a nature preserve in the 2900s."
],
[
"Avalet",
"Avalet is a hot ice giant, similar in size to Neptune but orbiting far closer to Anax. Tidally locked, one face of the gas planet is heated to incandescence while the other experiences temperatures cold enough to freeze the water and ammonia out of its mostly hydrogen atmosphere. This drives a cycle of winds that ring the entire planet, producing immense cyclones capable of throwing clouds to the edge of space."
],
[
"Avalon",
"This is a pristine and perfectly habitable world, with warm oceans and a temperate climate. The land is dominated by large reptiles similar to the dinosaurs that roamed the continents of ancient Earth. Some of the land reptiles are over twenty meters in length, and the sea holds monsters more than twice that size."
],
[
"Aventine",
"This is not a particularly warm world, but it is the best that the first Remnant refugees were able to find when they explored the Ember Waste. It is here that they built their capital, in a deep valley that is almost always shrouded in clouds. In meadows farther up the mountain slopes, a few particularly hardy food crops are grown, but for the most part the Remnant rely on artificial greenhouses or cultured yeast for protein supplements. Remnant cuisine is unlikely to ever become a draw for tourists, even if their isolation here is broken."
],
[
"Aviskir",
"Aviskir is a world of sweeping mountains and sparkling oceans. It also happens to be the Avgi homeworld, bustling with nine billion members of the species. Civilization has concentrated largely around bountiful mountain valleys and fjords, many warmed by hot springs and geothermal heat. The largest cities are built around the smaller peaks, laced with slender bridges and bright skyscrapers. They stand in contrast to the rural valley settlements below, which are said to offer simpler, more traditional lives."
],
[
"Babiali",
"Babiali's surface is a bona fide example of cataclysm. Ice and rock extends from horizon to horizon, with vast networks of cracks and fissures suggesting it was subject to some kind of sudden force fairly recently in its geological history."
],
[
"Baianus",
"From a distance, this large, icy moon is superficially reminiscent of Enceladus back in Sol: it is similarly exposed to its giant parent's radiation belts, and scans indicate countless tantalizing traces of chemicals that suggest there may be something more to the moon than it appears."
],
[
"Bailey",
"Bailey is a dead, nearly tidally locked world scarcely larger and more habitable than Mercury. As the planet slowly rotates relative to its host stars, its hot side is blasted into a molten wasteland, while its cool side hardens into a mineral-rich crust, a rarity in this region of space."
],
[
"Baliesa",
"One of the smallest \"Hot Jupiters\" known, Baliesa is a calm, undemanding gas giant. Occasional storms form near the terminator line between the night and day side, but soon split into smaller and smaller vortexes until they disappear. The violet-tinted skies of the upper atmosphere leave space to a bright pink-colored haze below, hampering visual navigation but otherwise not causing any trouble."
],
[
"Bank of Blugtad",
"This idyllic planet is home to almost as many Arachi as their homeworld in the neighboring system. It is also home to House Plumtab, the Arach guild in charge of banks and finance. Because pretty much every other sector of the Arach economy depends on loans from House Plumtab and trades stock on their equity exchanges, this House is quite influential throughout Arach space."
],
[
"Belug's Plunge",
"Although it is in Arach territory, Belug's Plunge is a cold enough planet that most of the native population is Saryds rather than Arachi. Most of the industry here focuses on mining metals and exotic elements to be used in building new extensions to the Rings. There is also a Saryd materials research lab trying to learn how to duplicate the advanced composites used by the Quarg. But Belug's Plunge is best known for the Academy, where cadets for the Heliarch defense forces are trained."

[
"Beryl",
"Beryl is a small space telescope deployed by the Gegno Scin to observe a nearby section of space home to mysterious dark nebulae and black holes. Only select Scin scientists are allowed to acquire research data from Beryl, which is otherwise not publicly accessible."
],
[
"Byigii",
"Although there is no evidence of a civilization on this barren, dry planet, there are many signs of haphazard mining and excavation by the Gegno, presumably for resources to construct the large station that orbits above. Among the several dig sites across the surface are also mountainous piles of scrap metals, junk, and other trash heaps, quite literally forming wastelands."
],
[
"Bloptab's Furnace",
"The surface of Bloptab's Furnace is rich in mineral deposits but too hot for any but the hardiest plants and insects to survive. The locals live deep underground in caverns carved out by the same automated mining machines that are used for collecting ore on the surface. When maintenance is needed for the surface robots, crews of engineers will wait until nightfall and then emerge from underground and do their best to complete the repairs before sunrise."
],
[
"Blubipad's Workshop",
"Dozens of small cities dot the valleys and hilltops of this warm and pleasant forest world. Due to a high tech manufacturing industry, there is plenty of work here for all the inhabitants, who hail from planets throughout Coalition space. With broad streets, ample parks, and gleaming skyscrapers, the cities bear witness to the very best of what Coalition society can accomplish when the three species work together."
],
[
"Blue Interior",
"Blue Interior is a strikingly beautiful earthlike world, covered mostly in oceans but with regions of rainforest, desert, mountains, and frozen tundra. Billions of Kimek live here, and there are also large Saryd and Arach populations in the cities whose climates are most agreeable to them. The Coalition often presents this world as a model of how their three species can benefit from sharing space with each other."
],
[
"Bluerun",
"This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone."
],
[
"Brass Second",
"This is a farming world. In the century prior to their discovery of space flight, billions of Kimek starved in a series of increasingly severe global famines. Fourteen thousand years later, their culture is still haunted by fear of not having enough food, and in response they have developed enough farms in their region of space to feed a population three times their size. Much of the food that they produce each year is either put into storage or simply recycled back into fertilizer for next year's crop."
],
[
"Bright Echo",
"This is the first world that the Saryds colonized outside of their own solar system. Although somewhat colder than their native planet, it developed into a thriving metropolitan world. The original settlers planned out in exacting detail how every part of the planet's land mass should be used, in order to satisfy their aesthetic ideal of blending residential areas with parks and farms. Large areas have also been set aside as undeveloped wilderness."
],
[
"Builder Settlement",
"This asteroid has seen hundreds of thousands of years of excavation done by swarms of Ka'sei drones. Although its size rivals that of a small moon, a large section has been hollowed out by the Builders to be filled with iridium, presumably as a long term storage facility. Due to its very low gravity, the asteroid is permanently covered in clouds of dust that hover only a few meters above the surface."
],
[
"Bunthro",
"Despite being a pristine world for colonizing, Bunthro appears to be almost entirely untouched by the Bunrodea. Aside from the spaceport, there are hardly any structures on the planet, most that you can find being small shrines built atop high locations such as hills or mountains."
],
[
"Byruca",
"Judging by Byruca's distance from its host star, you would assume that the planet would be habitable, albeit a little on the hot side. But as you approach, you find nothing but a lifeless wasteland; the surface of the planet looks as though it once harbored a teeming ecosystem, but now there's nothing but dead trees and deserts."
],
[
"Caelian",
"When the first members of the Remnant discovered this region of space, Caelian was the only habitable world they found with enough insolation to be able to operate solar-powered factories and bioreactors. The first settlements were scattered widely, with the houses hidden underground in order to be less visible from space, because they feared that the Alphas would overrun human space and eventually find their way into the Waste. Centuries later, when they learned that the Alpha Wars had ended, they began to expand the factories and settlements more openly."
],
[
"Calesi",
"Calesi is a binary planet, orbiting a common barycenter with its sister world, Pelesi. While Calesi is a molten world, heated by tidal forces, Pelesi remains cold enough for its surface to be covered in a thin layer of ice."
],
[
"Capitoline",
"The harsh landscape of Capitoline is a demonstration of the forces of nature at work. Lava flows and eruptions are regularly seen, and seismic activity is a daily occurrence. As a result, the surface is of comparatively recent origin. Despite this, you can spot a small survey station in the middle of an old lava field. In response to your landing computer's query, the transponder issues a terse statement about the automated scientific station and a warning that its defense systems are active."
],
[
"Carbuncle Station",
"Carbuncle is a tiny station owned and operated by Lovelace Labs. You assume that like most such stations, it is primarily a deuterium refinery, but aside from the docking bay the rest of the station is closed off to visitors. Given the reputation of Lovelace Labs for exotic research, there could be almost anything beyond those sealed-off bulkheads."
],
[
"Cassandra",
"In the late 2300s, Cassandra was the subject of one of the most ambitious terraforming projects performed by humanity up to that point; an attempt to rapidly modify its biosphere and jumpstart the process of making the planet more than perfect for human habitation."
],
[
"Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej",
"This planet is hot and dry, and holds on to only a tenuous atmosphere. Several enormous alien installations are present on its surface: semicircular bubbles that smoothly emerge from the rock as if they were grown from it, dotted with small pores which are each large enough for a starship. Inside them, the temperature is surprisingly quite habitable and you can observe the remains of what look like mines and industrial facilities within."
],
[
"Ceaseless Toil",
"The Saryds prefer to build their largest factories on sun-drenched, uninhabitable worlds, in order to allow more hospitable planets to be used for residences and recreation. Where possible, their factories harness solar power: either using mirrors to concentrate sunlight for solar foundries, or collecting energy through large fields of solar panels. The factories are almost entirely maintained by robots, which are capable not only of repairing damage but also of constructing entire new factories according to predefined plans."
],
[
"Ceilia'sei",
"Apart from one large, solid module, very little of this space station remains intact: the cloud of debris surrounding the core makes docking with it very difficult, and one side of the station even appears to have been blown up. The other part, however, has suffered much less damage, and the surface bristles with dozens of well-maintained turrets."
],
[
"Celeatis",
"Celeatis is a barren planet with mountains covering most of its surface. Even in the few flat highlands, the terrain is too sterile for any kind of vegetation to grow naturally. On some slopes, the outline of an outpost can still be recognized, but they are all uninhabited: some of the villages have been partially destroyed, and large amounts of dust cover the remains to the point that the original color can't be recognized anymore."
],
[
"Celestial Third",
"Celestial Third is the breadbasket of Kimek space. Most of its land mass is used for farming, augmented by seaweed farms and fisheries in the oceans and factories near the equator producing yeast and bacterial cultures as nutritional supplements. The first settlers came here more than thirteen thousand years ago, at a time when their home world had run out of arable land for farming and food was desperately needed."
],
[
"Charon Station",
"Charon Station provides hyperspace fuel for much of the southern galactic rim. It is a tiny, cramped, and aging station, with twice as many workers here as it was originally designed for."
],
[
"Charybdis Station",
"Charybdis Station is privately owned by the Syndicate. It is a massive deuterium refinery, with harvester drones constantly flying in and out to scoop hydrogen gas out of the upper atmosphere of the planet below. If you need to repair or refuel in this system, you will need to visit the neighboring world of Delve, instead of this station."
],
[
"Chyyra-Raaqa-Tuur",
"This snow-covered planet orbits a dim star, making its surface dark and bitterly cold. Near the north pole, there are signs of large-scale excavation, possibly for materials to construct the station that orbits it."
],
[
"Cipi",
"Cipi's forests and mountains are a suitable place for the Gegno Scin's less active population, home to more quiet industries. The population of this planet is limited, and architecture is built high in mountain ranges to avoid hurting the natural landscapes of the planet. This provides the Scin with healthy crop and hunting seasons to supply their main population without the interference of polluting industry."
],
[
"Clink",
"About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
],
[
"Cloudfire",
"Cloudfire's atmosphere is unusually hazy, with almost constant cloud cover, making agriculture unproductive here even though it is a warm and damp environment. There are several major cities here that were abandoned centuries ago, due to conflict with the Unfettered. The one major city that remains is the closest thing the Hai have to a military base, with new supplies of weapons and ammunition constantly pouring in from the rest of Hai space."
],
[
"Corral of Meblumem",
"The Corral of Meblumem is home to two major industries: uranium mining, and longcow ranching. The long lifetime of the longcows means that their bodies can easily accumulate dangerous loads of heavy metals if exposed to them, so the two industries are kept separated by conservation zones dozens of kilometers wide. The dark strips of primal forests separating the red-brown pit mines from the tan and light green of the pastures makes the land look like a stained glass patchwork from above."
],
[
"Crataegusa",
"At a distance, Crataegusa has a plain appearance, with linear shear cloud lines circling the planet. Beneath the surface, however, the atmosphere is a turbulent maelstrom of cyclonic winds at odds with the surface appearance."
],
[
"Crossroads",
"Crossroads is a thoroughly unbeautiful planet. The scrawny local vegetation has blue and purple leaves, shocking to your human eyes, and grows only reluctantly, leaving the land looking like a blighted wasteland."
],
[
"Cyife",
"This lonely, icy moon is the only non-gaseous celestial body within this rather quiet star system. Although there are no signs of life here due to the extremely low temperatures, certain parts of the surface glimmer oddly compared to others, as if to imply something may once have been here before."
],
[
"Cyreal",
"Cyreal was one of the first extrasolar worlds to be colonized by the Avgi, and, as with the other neighboring worlds, it was settled by slower than light starships. During a period of widespread scattered settlement, this low-gravity moon's sharp mountains and tall forests became popular with asteroid miners grown weary of cramped spacecraft. When the hyperdrive brought unprecedented immigration from other worlds, conservationists set aside large swathes of the moon as natural preserves, concentrating most residents in a small group of dense cities."
],
[
"Dagon Station",
"Originally built in the 25th century as a corporate military outpost, Dagon Station's notoriety stems from its past as a privateer base; its infamous mercenary fleets all but decided the victors in the constant wars in this region during the 26th and 27th centuries. As those conflicts subsided, those privateers began turning towards piracy. Their influence was brought to an end when a fleet from Earth took control of the station, later becoming a military base for the fledgling Republic."
],
[
"Dancer",
"Dancer is a resource-rich world, but with unusually violent weather and strong atmospheric convection, which leads to lightning storms stronger than on any other settled human world. Straying outside on foot is unthinkable, and it is not uncommon to find a small crater blasted out by a particularly energetic strike."
],
[
"Darkcloak",
"Darkcloak is a world that is almost always obscured by a thick layer of clouds, making it difficult to produce food here."
],
[
"Darkmetal",
"Darkmetal is a cold, dry mining world, the source of much of the heavy metals that are used in Hai space. A haze of slightly radioactive dust hangs in the sky whenever it has been more than a week since the last rainstorm. Most of the mining is carried out by slow-moving vehicles the size of a small city, which ingest layers of dirt and bedrock, crush it to extract any valuable elements, then mix the remaining material with water to form a concrete-like slurry that can be extruded in solid blocks, to reduce the amount of additional dust that is added to the atmosphere."

"Darkstone",
"Darkstone is a rainy, mountainous planet. The major continents are spidered with rivers and green valleys. A few enterprising settlers have built farming communities here, but the population remains low because of the threat of piracy from neighboring systems."
],
[
"Darkwaste",
"This planet seems to have all the conditions necessary for a vibrant, Earth-like ecology. The gravity and temperature are moderate, and there is a fair amount of surface water, although the oceans are quite small. However, aside from a few stunted plants and lichen, there is almost no native life here. Given how skilled the Hai appear to be at terraforming other worlds, it is strange that this one has been left barren."
],
[
"Deadman's Cove",
"Deadman's Cove is an ocean planet; the continents take up only a tenth of its surface area. Legends tell of massive sea creatures hiding in the deeps: serpents hundreds of meters long; colossal sea turtles; strange tentacled monsters and exotic fish."
],
[
"Deep",
"Deep is a sparsely populated world of small island archipelagos surrounded by vast expanses of empty ocean. There is not enough land for any large cities or serious industry to emerge, so most of the inhabitants live in small fishing villages. The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is somewhat dimmer than you are used to."
],
[
"Deep Treasure",
"Thick layers of kelp and plankton sediment have gathered on the floors of Deep Treasure's oceans over the eons, leaving behind rich deposits of oil that the Saryds harvest to make plastics and other hydrocarbon products. In the shallower seas, shoals of fish swim among some of the most varied and extensive coral reefs found anywhere in Coalition space."
],
[
"Deep Water",
"The upper layers of Deep Water's mantle are unusually hot, resulting in continuous volcanic eruptions that shroud its skies in ash and particulate matter. Aside from one small continent most of the surface is ocean, but the volcanoes have formed hundreds of separate island chains and archipelagos, each of which is home to unique plant and animal species."
],
[
"Deka Dathnak",
"For whatever reason, someone has gone to the trouble of bombarding this gas giant with thousands of nuclear warheads. Swirls of radioactive isotopes are plainly visible in the lower atmosphere, and the amount of soot floating around points towards a large amount of some material having been incinerated in the recent past. The Korath were presumably the ones who decided to drop several gigatons worth of nuclear weapons into this gas giant during their civil war, but exactly why they did so remains unknown."
],
[
"Deli Kasi",
"Deli Kasi is a world of vast oceans and mountainous continents. At many locations across the planet, the tall mountain ranges trap moist air from the oceans, causing large amounts of rainfall in concentrated areas. This, combined with snow melt from the mountains, creates large fertile plains across much of the habitable land area, which has led to Deli Kasi becoming a major farming world."
],
[
"Deli Kat",
"Deli Kat orbits the dimmest star out of any of the inhabited systems in this region of space, a star not too dissimilar to Sol. Although the planet orbits farther from its host star than Earth does, its slightly thicker atmosphere seems to balance that out, resulting in a mostly Earth-like climate. The planet's many vast plains and river systems additionally help to make Deli Kat a fertile farming world."

[
"Delodir",
"Delodir is proof that life can exist even in the most unlikely of places. Despite the moon's lack of sunlight, given that the Mote system has no bright, luminescent star, life has managed to thrive at the bottom of Delodir's subsurface oceans, buried deep beneath a thick layer of ice. Energy is trickled into the biosphere from hydrothermal vents, which are in turn powered by tidal heating produced by the gravitational influence of both the brown dwarf and gas giant within the system."

"Delve of Bloptab",
"This is a mining world, hotter than even the Arachi would prefer but still much more habitable than its sister world of Bloptab's Furnace. It is home to House Ablomab, the guild of mining and metalworking, and the dry climate makes it possible to store stockpiles of iron, steel, and other metals here without worrying about rust. Supposedly the warehouses here contain enough raw materials to double the size of the Heliarch war fleet if needed; the Arachi like to be able to trust that they are prepared for any eventuality."

[
"Desi Seledrak",
"Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles. It may be centuries before the skies clear and this world begins to thaw."

[
"Devru Kaska",
"The Kor Sestor prefer to develop planets rather than planting stations in space, but this is a necessary exception: a deuterium refinery that harvests hydrogen both from the gas giant it orbits, and from the strong solar wind from this system's primary star."
],
[
"Diligent Hand",
"On this factory world, robotic workers operate the factories, repair themselves, and keep the solar power stations free of sand with very little direction or assistance from their Saryd creators. Each factory complex has its own landing pads for the freighters that drop off raw materials and receive the processed goods."
],
[
"Disara",
"Disara is a highly developed world, with multiple large cities on each of the planet's continents. Each of the cities spread out into more suburban-like regions, which extend further into rural and wilderness zones. Unlikely many other worlds, Disara has no one primary industry that it dominates in. Instead, the planet does a bit of everything, having a rather strong internal economy."
],
[
"Dlia Jzaur",
"Dlia Jzaur has a few hotter seasons than normal due to the binary stars at the system's center, where beautiful eclipses can be seen weekly. The much smaller secondary star is believed to be a rogue captured by the larger one, but it is slowly drifting away. There seems to be evidence of recent colonization efforts by the Gegno, but they appear to have been abandoned due to increasing warfare in nearby systems."
],
[
"Dokimi Range",
"This distant planetoid, far from anything of importance, has been designated as the Twilight Guard's dedicated weapons proving ground. Aside from a small outpost, which hosts a laboratory exclusively geared towards data collection and analysis, the surface is a barren wasteland of gleaming nitrogen ice and reddish tholins."
],
[
"Double Haze",
"The haze that perpetually blankets this world is actually an organic soup rich in nutrients and airborne bacteria, and the rain that falls here forms a sort of natural fertilizer. The entire planet's surface, including every quiet nook or alleyway in the cities, is covered in moss, grass, shrubs, or other green and growing things."
],
[
"Drekag Firask",
"Much of the surface of this world is covered in water. Ships the size of small cities float in the oceans, carried by the tides. The ships are designed to incubate algae and other microorganisms that once provided the Korath both with food and with a source of mixed hydrocarbons similar to petroleum. With the Korath gone and the food no longer needed, many of the ships have fallen into disrepair, or have drifted into the polar regions and been crushed against icebergs."
],
[
"Dueitch Ae",
"In order to pursue biological and other important scientific research, this green, lush world was designated as the Gegno Scin's capital. Much unlike the heavy industry of the core Gegno worlds, Dueitch Ae's surface still supports many natural ecosystems, and most importantly, is home to a notable amount of water bodies. The Scin effectively limit their expansion on the planet, even at the cost of their population's growth, in order to preserve the flourishing life on it as long as possible."
],
[
"Dueyu Eitch",
"The historic homeworld of all Gegno, Dueyu Eitch is a rugged, rocky world covered with enormous metropolises and megastructures. Each city is based on an elevated platform, and starting from the bottom up, the buildings are more advanced the farther they reach into the sky. Larger cities are lit by the varying reds and oranges of industrial forges, and more urban areas are speckled with yellow and green. Beneath the heavily populated surface are traces of enormous cavities, suggesting the Gegno began a majority of their ancestry in the ground."

[
"Dune",
"Dune is a mostly desert world, which was uninhabited until very recently when geologists discovered that the bedrock under the desert is home to many rare mineral deposits and gemstones."
],
[
"Dusk Companion",
"Dusk Companion's moon is so large and orbits so close to the planet that the tidal forces even affect the planet's plate tectonics. The skies here are frequently blanketed in a volcanic haze. This world is rich in oil deposits, a relic of a past when more life flourished here, but drilling for oil is costly because the shifting ground can damage drills or seal up previously productive bore-holes. Since this also makes processing difficult, the oil is exported off-world for processing into plastics, instead of having the manufacturing performed locally."
],
[
"Dustmaker",
"The surface of this planet, when it is not obscured by dust storms, receives enough sunlight to power not only large solar farms, but solar furnaces as well, which the Hai use for manufacturing a large variety of goods. Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there is almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles."
],
[
"Dwelling of Speloog",
"With a wide band of tropical rainforests around its equator, this planet's climate is ideal for the Arachi. Several billion of them live here, and many of the workers assisting with the expansion of the Heliarch ringworlds come from this planet."
],
[
"Earth",
"The ancestral home world of humanity, Earth has a population twice that of any other inhabited planet. Sprawling cities cover large portions of its surface, many of them overcrowded and dangerous. Some people work to scrape together enough money to leave, while at the same time others, born on distant worlds, make a pilgrimage of sorts to see this planet that once cradled the entirety of the human species."
],
[
"Eavine",
"Although its climate is very cold and most of the surface is covered in snow, Eavine has a crust rich with rare metals and minerals hard to find elsewhere. Entire valleys on the surface have been completely stripped of their resources, likely used in the massive complex of half buried buildings which appears to be the only settlement on this moon that remains today."
],
[
"Echo",
"This is a small Quarg outpost, which you suspect was built mostly to keep an eye on Tarazed Corporation and their alien-influenced research on the planet below. Like most Quarg worlds, the gravity is much too low here for it to be a feasible human colony, and although there is an atmosphere, it is too thin for a human being to breathe. Supposedly the Quarg have lungs designed for a continuous one way airflow, like a bird's lungs, rather than the ordinary in and out flow of human lungs; this is what enables them to survive on low-gravity, low-atmosphere worlds."
],
[
"Eeu Mnai",
"In contrast to the flourishing world of Mnai, Eeu Mnai is a dull dwarf planet composed mostly of rock and stone. While still within habitable range of the system's binary stars, the surface of this world is rough and jagged, and is dominated by cold fall and winter seasons. This environment is not inhospitable, however, as various forms of life, such as subterranean mammals and insectoid creatures, have adapted to these conditions."
],
[
"Ef Aourtdye",
"Ef Aourtdye is primarily a factory world where a large portion of mined materials are refined, processed, and re-distributed across parts of Gegno space. Large factory and refinery structures can be seen engraved into the mountainous surfaces of the planet, with some cities found in less crowded valleys. Once home to a much larger population, a major portion of the cities are now desolate as efforts have been pushed to either more distant planets, or pulled back to the ever-growing homeworld of the Gegno."
],
[
"Ef Osch",
"Ef Osch is the first world found by the Gegno to have a substantial part of the surface covered in water. Pristine beaches surround tropical land masses, and many strange creatures occupy the depths. Despite being appropriated by the Gegno Scin, there is a relatively low amount of construction work done on the mainland. Most industrial work takes place on large, vessel-like complexes that travel the oceans."

[
"Eldergrasp",
"A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. There is a generously appointed reception area with an orderly on duty who informs you that this is a respite home for the elderly, and unless you have family here, you will not be permitted to wander the station."
],
[
"Elek Kartanu",
"You have no idea what has happened to this planet, and you are not sure you want to know. The atmosphere is unusually hot and wet for a planet this distance from its sun, and the ocean levels seem to have dropped significantly in the recent past, leaving barnacles and bleached coral exposed to the air all around the shorelines. The wind is frenzied and full of wild energy, and the fog moves like a living creature."
],
[
"Elthe",
"Elthe's parent gas giant, Sef, hosts a rich system of rings and moons chock-full of valuable minerals. Lucrative returns made by independent miners attracted many settlers from Araio who became discontented with planetary life, leading to the rings of Sef becoming a wild frontier, one with orbital tether robberies and mass driver shootouts."
],
[
"Eminonu",
"Eminonu's notably green rocks show a remarkably high copper content and the historic presence of atmospheric water. Scattered vegetative debris suggests that this world was, until recently, some variety of garden planet, albeit likely a cold one. Today the vast majority of moisture is locked up in ice fields, and the ambient temperatures are far too cold for even hardy lichens to survive."
],
[
"Enbye",
"A cold, mountainous world on the very edge of the binary system's habitable area, Enbye maintains the massive shipyards of the Gegno Vi, using raw resources gathered from the nearby volcanic planet to churn out hull after hull for warships. Many large canyons decorate the surface and are used as weapon test sites, and in one of the largest canyons lies a shipyard several times larger and older-looking than the rest."
],
[
"Enn Bue",
"Lengthy oval-like shipyards speckle the surface of this otherwise inhospitable desert planet, home to most of the Gegno Scin's ship production. A majority of material wealth comes from the neighboring gas giant's moons; however, the strong gravitational pull occasionally generates natural disasters that ravage the surface. Despite all of this, the Scin remain vigilant and efficient in their craftworks."

[
"Entantel",
"Entantel is notable in that it is almost entirely comprised of water ice. With a diminutive rocky core, its low average density results in a very low gravitational acceleration for its size."

"Erabuthro",
"Erabuthro is the capital of the Bunrodean Hegemony, home to the throne of the Queen. Only those with the blessings of the Queen are allowed to set foot on the planet's surface, although receiving such blessing doesn't necessarily guarantee a warm welcome."
],
[
"Eragarthro",
"Eragarthro is a large ocean moon of a moderately sized gas giant in the system of Eragaru Le. Although orbiting a gas giant means that the moon is often cast in shadow for multiple days at a time, the planet that the moon orbits is also firmly in the nearby star's habitable zone, making it a not too unpleasant place to live."

[
"Ergastirio Station",
"When Consonance researchers' need for plentiful space and isolation outgrew what was available on Peripheria or Navigeo, dedicated as they were to habitation and shipbuilding respectively, this mid-sized station was built to accommodate a state-of-the-art collection of laboratory facilities. The work here is largely aimed towards weapons research, a necessary consequence of the fight against the Aberrant."
],
[
"Esayaku Fen",
"The Kor Mereti robots seem to prefer to build their factories and refineries in space rather than on planets, harvesting their raw materials from asteroids so that they do not have to deal with gravity, or atmosphere, or rain, or sandstorms. They have left this desert world unoccupied."
],
[
"Esek Stovar",
"This Kor Mereti outpost is far enough from the front in their war with the Kor Sestor that it has fallen somewhat into disuse. The largest docking bays are still kept open for refueling and repairs, but the sections of the station that used to be living quarters have been sealed off."
],
[
"Eskar Kortuka",
"This is a barely habitable frozen world. The Korath built nothing here except for a few small mining facilities, now abandoned. There is no sign that the occupants were forced to leave by violence. Rather, it seems that they simply packed up their things one day and moved out. The buildings they left behind are now half-covered by snowdrifts."

"Esperaktu Station",
"This small space station has plenty of blast marks on its outer hull, but they have all been patched and the interior still holds atmosphere. But although still intact, the station is entirely abandoned."

[
"Esquiline",
"Esquiline's wispy skies billow with raging winds and continuous storms. The Remnant have discovered that its upper atmosphere contains a useful source of certain chemicals. Although few spacecraft can penetrate its depths, specially-designed aero scoop drones can be seen regularly dipping into the atmosphere for shipments to Aventine."

"Essime",
"Starting from an early age, most Vi devote their lives to their endless trials of survival, finding themselves either on the frontlines of conflict or in the backlines of industry. As they grow old, they retire and spend the rest of their lives on green planets such as this one, where they hunt animals for food and till acres of land."
],
[
"Esstch",
"This desert world is the first world the Gegno left their imprint on outside of their home. Littered about with various recording instruments of times past, Esstch represents a historical stepping stone for the Gegno. However, due to the proximity of the system's star, it is too hot to be colonized."
],
[
"Everhope",
"This station consistently has a large number of Hai warships docked at it, and further investigation reveals that it serves as the principal supply of fuel for the Hai military, as well as the staging point for resupplying ships heading to defend Wah Ki from the Unfettered. A monument beyond the docking area entrance attests to its history performing a similar role during the Korath raids before that."
],
[
"Factory of Eblumab",
"The tiny sun that the Factory of Eblumab orbits is too small to provide much power, so the manufacturing plants here are mostly powered by nuclear reactors running on radioisotopes that are mined and refined locally. It is a hot, dry, and mostly barren world, and most of the workers here are young and single, hoping to build up enough wealth to move somewhere more pleasant."
],
[
"Faliete",
"Veiled behind roiling storms, the silhouette of an enormous structure is suspended within the planet's upper clouds. Automated drones swarm the complex like moths to a flame, carrying raw components to mysterious ends. Occasionally, the factory disgorges vast slabs of smoky glass and metallic alloy. They glint in the dim light as they flutter downwards, fracturing into ever-smaller mosaics of scrap as they descend."

[
"Far Garden",
"Saryd culture places high value on connection to the natural world and to settings suitable for silent reflection. This is one of their most populous worlds, but even in the cities more land is set aside for parks and wild spaces than for buildings."
],
[
"Far Home",
"The weather on Far Home is a nearly perfect blend of what is most comfortable for each of the three member species of the Coalition. The mountains and boreal forests have been settled by the Saryds, the grasslands and savanna by the Kimek, and the rainforests by the Arachi, even though this is technically part of Saryd territory."

"Far Monad",
"The weather on Far Monad is actually rather pleasant. If it were not a lonely planet orbiting a dying sun in a region of space that few species visit and none claim for their own, it could have become a fruitful farming world or perhaps even a metropolitan center."

[
"Far'en Lai",
"When the Korath were banished to the Core, they were left with only one living world, a planet they call \"Far'en Lai,\" meaning, \"the last candle-flame.\" Afraid that this planet's biosphere will turn to dust in their hands like all the other worlds they once controlled, the Korath have left Far'en Lai entirely unsettled and unexploited. It is rumored that the terms of their exile dictate that if Far'en Lai withers and dies, the remaining Korath exiles will be exterminated, but that if they can learn to make the planet flourish, their place in the galaxy will be restored."

[
"Fara Skaeruti",
"This station serves both as a deuterium refinery and as a factory. A large number of small spires protrude from the hull of the station, each carrying fuel pipes, so that ships can simply dock with one of the spires to refuel instead of having to navigate inside a hangar."

[
"Farpoint",
"Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry."
],
[
"Farseer",
"With enough money, you can buy a sunny day. Farseer is an ocean resort world, where much of the local tax revenue is spent on the terraforming equipment that moderates the weather. Real estate prices fluctuate wildly in times of political anxiety, because the idyllic climate exists only by government fiat."
],
[
"Farwater",
"In human space, this system would probably have been left unsettled, because its sun produces too much ultraviolet radiation for animals to survive for long on its surface. But the Hai have instead turned this warm ocean world into a massive incubator for photosynthetic algae and bacteria. Each species is genetically engineered to produce one or more medical or nutritional compounds that they can make use of. Barges travel slowly through the oceans harvesting these microorganisms out of the water and separating out the chemical compounds they provide."
],
[
"Featherweight",
"Featherweight is a small world, with lighter than normal gravity. Centuries ago, because of its remoteness, this world was the site of some illegal genetic experiments, and rumors say that the current inhabitants are the result of those experiments. Because they are so well adapted to low gravity, few of them choose to leave, and very few outsiders choose to settle here, so this world's culture remains quite insular and detached from the rest of the galaxy."

"Fek Rembatu",
"Everything on this planet that is made of metal is overgrown with a thick layer of a reddish lichen or fungus. In the cities, the tallest buildings look like they have been melted or half digested by the fungus: tall towers lean at crazy angles, and smaller buildings are entirely buried and indistinct. The air smells like sauerkraut and roses."
],
[
"Felorap",
"Felorap is a hot, steamy ocean world, with a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Despite being a fairly old planet, periodic asteroid bombardment has deprived it of the reprieve needed to develop complex life, and so the biosphere remains confined to extremophiles around the many hydrothermal vents that can be found on the ocean floor."

[
"Fenrir Station",
"Fenrir Station is a bustling refinery, and from the way the foremen looked at you when you stepped off your ship, they seem to be eager for new recruits. In addition to harvesting deuterium, this is one of the few refinery stations in human space which also collects helium-3, an isotope with some exotic uses in medical imaging and in energy research."

"Feo Platform",
"Hastily assembled from the parts of a mothballed interstellar laser driver, the Feo Platform is an enormous free electron laser intended to provide fire support to Avgi fleets defending the Tangled Shroud from Aberrant invasion. While a few Aberrations sometimes manage to slip past, the beam together with the fleetgroup the platform supports have so far managed to hold the line."

"Firelode",
"The Unfettered are operating several large strip mines here to collect uranium and plutonium to fuel the generators in their warships. Older, abandoned mining pits are scattered throughout the planet's surface. As a result of the mining activity, the groundwater here has become badly contaminated."

"Firka Tesk",
"This appears to have once been an inhabited world, and the remnants of a few cities still remain. But the planet's crust has been cracked like an eggshell, releasing rivers of lava and leaving behind unnaturally steep mountains and fault lines. The wind whistles and howls through the rifts and fissures as if the planet itself is screaming in pain. A thick haze of sulfur dioxide and ash hangs over everything."

"Flood",
"The scenic fjords and rugged mountains make Flood a popular tourist destination. Nearly all the land in the planet's temperate zone is covered in mountains, making traditional agriculture difficult."
],
[
"Flowing Fields",
"During the rainy season, the plants on Flowing Fields grow so rapidly that the grass can tower more than three meters tall. Although they look verdant and serene when viewed from a distance, the grasslands are also home to many dangerous predators, including hundreds of species of snakes and ferocious packs of carnivorous rodents that can bring down animals many times their size. During the dry season, the rodent packs build domed hutches out of woven grass and mud where they shelter from the sun and the dusty wind."

[
"Follower",
"Follower is on the edge of the Paradise Planets region of space: not really one of them yet, but aspiring to be. It is prosperous, but from manufacturing rather than law or finance or venture capitalism. A significant fraction of the local taxes collected here are being spent on terraforming, raising global temperatures and reducing seasonal fluctuations. The goods produced here always have a ready market to purchase them, so Follower's job economy is considered very stable."

[
"Forpelog",
"Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, but the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen."

"Fourth Shadow",
"In all of Coalition space, this is the one planet that comes closest to deserving being called a slum world. More than ten billion Kimek live here, mostly in densely packed and run-down apartment buildings on the outskirts of the cities. Unlike more prosperous Coalition worlds, the city centers here are reserved for factories rather than for parks or government buildings or civic centers."

[
"Gamla",
"Unlike most fictional portrayals of precursor species, the previous inhabitants of this dry, salty moon did not leave behind any ancient technological ruins or monolithic stone constructs. Instead, the evidence of their past existence is in the form of tapped mineral veins, concentrations of unmistakably artificial radioisotopes, and a wide belt of orbiting debris degraded to little more than lumps of metal and dust."

[
"Gara Pvu",
"Beautiful landscapes cover this planet, and unlike nearby systems, the climate is more than welcoming to a human being. Most remarkably, there are small selections of elegant curved structures and overpasses spread out in patches along the surface. While they are fantastical in appearance, they are unmistakably not part of the land itself, and must have been left long ago by some other species that also managed to leave the natural beauty of this planet intact - either that, or it's been so long since their disappearance that nature has retaken everything."

[
"Garden Empyreal",
"Not including the trio of Quarg ringworlds, this is the largest megastructure in Coalition space. Arrays of gigantic metal pyramids lay at every angle, each nearly a dozen times larger than the average space station. Spread out over the planet's upper atmosphere, these so-called \"hubs\" are connected by long, inextensible, and extremely sturdy wires, ensuring no part of the structure is destabilized."
],
[
"Gentle Rain",
"The rainforests on Gentle Rain are home to spiders so large that their webs are strung from one tree to another, and their typical prey is birds rather than insects. Another, equally large species of spider is able to leap four or five meters into the air in order to snatch a bird out of a passing flock. The rainforest trees grow so thick that except for occasional clearings, very little light actually filters through the leaves and reaches the ground, and during the rainy season the dirt is transformed into pools of stagnant mud."
],
[
"Gestli",
"Despite its smooth appearance from orbit, the surface of Gestli is a fractured mess of jagged mountains and rough hills. The tectonic activity of its moon, large enough to qualify as a binary pair, causes an almost perpetual global earthquake that can be felt by simply standing on the planet."
],
[
"Ghneoe",
"Ghneoe's orbital period is dominated by a very long dry season due to the binary stars at the system's center. However, during a short portion of the year, Ghneoe experiences an intense water cycle that results in a boom of greenery and wildlife activity, developing a short-lived but flourishing ecosystem. Much of the flora and fauna have adapted to such drastic shifts in climate, and return to a dormant state once the intense heat cycle returns."
],
[
"Giaru Gegno",
"The quality of its structure suggests that this Quarg ringworld has to have been completed rather recently, but there are some notable differences that don't seem Quarg-like. Some of the hangars and docks on the ring are oddly larger than others, and the inner quarters are wider and taller than what is normal for a Quarg. The hangar you currently are parked in, however, seems to be devoid of these characteristics, and is similar to ones in the Quarg ringworld in human space."
],
[
"Giiq-Oj-Sol",
"The specific atmosphere of this planet combined with its volcanic activity have combined to make the perfect conditions for the geological production of strands of natural glass, which are thrown into the atmosphere by volcanoes and then carried by high winds all over the planet. This makes stepping outside of one's ship without some sort of protection a very bad idea, as the ground is littered with sharp fragments and the air is filled with microscopic glass particles, both capable of rapidly destroying living tissue."

"Giiq-Sou-Kella",
"Small, atmospherically placid, and tectonically stable, this planet is completely covered in a global ocean composed of liquid methane. A few small rock outcrops emerge above the offgassing waves, but there are no dry landmasses larger than a square kilometer or so."

"Giverstone",
"On this mining world, the Hai are using boring machines to drill tunnels straight into the hearts of the mountains. Each tunnel twists and turns to intersect the regions of rock with the highest concentrations of valuable ore. Most of the tunnels also join up with other tunnels that have been dug through the same mountains, so that there are multiple exits from any given point in the mines."

"Gliese",
"A shine of magenta emanates from the depths of this planet, suggesting the presence of a strong heat source in the core of Gliese. While the color is pleasant at first, its brightness gets nauseating over time. The winds are calm and no storms are in sight, and if you look closely you can see creatures that look like very small jellyfish emitting a soft glow."
],
[
"Glittering Ice",
"The climate on Glittering Ice is so cold for most of the year that the creatures here have evolved thick layers of feathers, fur, or fat to keep themselves warm. As a result nearly all of them, from the smallest rodents to the largest predators, are practically spherical, appearing as shapeless blobs; for many of them it is hard for a casual observer to even figure out which side of them is their head."

There is a reception area just beyond the docking bay with an extremely long desk and a receptionist who informs you that this is a respite home for the elderly, and unless you have family here, you will not be permitted to wander the station. There are different service functions at various kiosks along the desk, as well as a small sales counter with handicrafts made by the residents."

"Graede",
"Unlike the homeworld of the Gegno, the capital of the Vi is covered in astounding natural beauty where the land is untouched. Vast tracts of forests spread across relatively low mountain ranges, and a variety of both small and large marsupials can be seen running to and fro. Despite all of this, there are many plowed fields that have been converted to industrial ranges and shipyards, and several large cities have begun to grow towards the sky."

"Grakhord",
"Although human beings who do not mind living in low gravity are welcome to settle here, Grakhord is part of Quarg territory, and has been terraformed to meet their environmental needs rather than those of human beings. The full extent of the Quarg mining operations here are not known, but rumors say that they have tunnels reaching down almost halfway to the moon's core, and Quarg ships can also sometimes be seen harvesting hydrogen gas from the upper atmosphere of the gas giant that Grakhord orbits."

"Greenbloom",
"The islands and continents on this planet are almost entirely covered in marshes, rainforests, and (near the poles) dense coniferous forests, and the oceans appear green from above due to thick algae blooms and floating kelp mats. The overabundance of flora is caused by Greenbloom's major volcanoes, which constantly spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."

"Although not strictly humid by the standards of a planet, the air here has a rich, moist, and faintly verdant quality atypical of a space station. The station is run by the Hei Low Io species preservation foundation, and each of its four branches features a different internal climate showcasing life from distant worlds. An infographic proclaims it to be the largest collection in the galaxy of rare organisms sourced from private collections, rebuilt from genetic samples, or rescued before being exterminated after being deemed invasive on Hai worlds. It also mentions that certain exhibits have been improved in some cases with species recently acquired from human space through secret trade deals."

"More commonly referred to as \"Checkpoint of Ablodab,\" this enormous station was built shortly after the end of the Coalition's war against the Quarg, meant to serve as a regional dry dock and supply base that damaged combat ships could return to after some time at the front lines. The lack of any subsequent counterattack, though, shifted its role to being a simple refueling hub for passing merchant ships, its dozens of warship-sized hangars remaining mostly unused."

"Gue Faur",
"Like most Gegno Scin planets, Gue Faur is a steep jungle world bursting with many different forms of life. Surprisingly, a majority of the Scin's population resides on this planet rather than their capital. A great percentage of inhabitants consists of researchers and scientists, and all sorts of greenhouses and biodomes are visible everywhere."

[
"Hai-home",
"This is the home world of the Hai. Well over half the planet's surface is oceans. The land is mostly covered by sprawling cities, except for some mountain ranges too high or too snowy to build on. Despite its population of nearly eight billion, Hai-home is relatively free of pollution or overcrowding."
],
[
"Hammer of Debrugt",
"House Chamgar claims that their advances in aerospace and weapon technology were instrumental in driving the Quarg out of Coalition space about six millennia ago. Given how much more advanced the Saryds and Kimek were at the time, their claims are likely an exaggeration. But, there is no doubt that in the present day the home of House Chamgar has developed into an industrial world as productive as any in Coalition space, partly because this world is rich enough in natural resources that there is little need to import raw materials from elsewhere."

[
"Harmony",
"The first settlers who came to Harmony were an Amish community seeking a place where they could live a quiet life and do work with their own hands instead of relying on machines and computers. Their community grew to millions of people, who now live side by side with other, more modern settlers. There are still regions of the planet where motorized vehicles are prohibited, but in other places trucks and horse-drawn buggies share the same roads."

[
"Haven",
"Haven was founded by highly successful \"privateers\" nearly two centuries ago. Since then, as rival bands of pirates have fought over it, it has changed hands fourteen times, but has never been successfully invaded by the Republic. Numerous small manufacturing shops sell outfits that cannot be bought legally, and there is even a small shipyard where customized ships are sold to those who have the right connections."

"Haze",
"Haze is a manufacturing world, covered in sprawling cities. It is a relatively prosperous planet, but so far the inhabitants have chosen to spend more of their terraforming budget on climate control than on pollution reduction."

[
"Heartland",
"Heartland is a pleasant world, with a geography mostly consisting of low hills, plains, and oceans. The farms here produce bountiful crops, and as a result it has drawn tens of millions of settlers. Many of them now work in factories or assembly lines, in which most of the farm equipment used here and in the surrounding systems is built."
],
[
"Heartvalley",
"An extreme amount of tectonic activity in its distant past has left Heartvalley with mountain ranges five to ten kilometers high in some places. Most of the Hai settlements here are in the valleys closer to sea level, where the air is dense enough for them to breathe comfortably. The tectonic activity has left many ancient sea-beds exposed, providing access to bountiful supplies of oil. To the Hai, oil is too precious a resource to be used for fuel; instead they process it into plastic and use the byproducts in other chemical processes."

[
"Heavenly Halls",
"This solitary gas giant was given its name due to a phenomenon shared by no other planet in Coalition space. The icy rings surrounding it grow denser the closer they are to the planetary surface; just a few kilometers into the sea of clouds, the small frozen specks are replaced by sizable, frigid asteroids. Curiously, most of these larger asteroids have tunnels cutting through their interiors, inspiring some of the bolder Saryd explorers to try and colonize these \"frozen palaces.\""

"Hephaestus",
"Hephaestus is home to Syndicated Systems, which manufactures parts used in shipyards throughout human space. Although not always the highest quality or most technologically advanced, ship outfits produced by the Syndicate are quite affordable and sufficient for any ordinary pilot's needs. The executives of many other companies have been known to make a pilgrimage of sorts to this planet, to witness firsthand how the Syndicate has made their production lines here so efficient and dependable."

[
"Hermes",
"No one is permitted to settle on Hermes without a government permit. It is a sparsely populated world, mostly used for medical research and development - including some research that, if the rumors are true, are carried out here in isolation so that if something goes wrong, entire districts can be quarantined or even \"sterilized\" by orbital bombardment."

"Hilothire",
"While Hilothire contains an oxygen-rich atmosphere, it is almost entirely covered in icy oceans. At the poles, massive ice caps stretch nearly to the tropics. Pristine icebergs often float down to the equator, where they accumulate around the few rocky islands that peek above the waves."

"Hope",
"In the year 2994, Hope was a somewhat cold but otherwise hospitable planet, home to a burgeoning population of almost two million people. But that year, a supervolcano eruption ejected so much dust into the upper atmosphere that a new ice age set in and the planet became unlivable."

[
"Hopper",
"Hopper is a temperate world of oceans, mountains, and plains, but with unfortunately high levels of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. Metal and stone that are exposed to the atmosphere corrode quickly, requiring frequent maintenance. As a result, Hopper has only a few small settlements on it, and most of the industry is focused on underground mining."

[
"Humo",
"Interestingly, this gas giant is not only made from gaseous elements; sand is being pushed around in the air and accumulates on the windows of your ship. A constant updraft from the center of the planet seems to be the reason for the presence of sand in the upper atmosphere. While the sand itself is not dangerous, it may pile up in your ship's mechanics if you stay here for too long."

[
"Hydra Station",
"This station is so run-down that most of the workers carry oxygen masks in case a meteoroid punctures the hull, and a few of them are even dressed in full space suits. The deuterium refinery here is barely operating, the number of workers is minimal, and nearly half of them seem to be busy just welding patches onto the hull to hold the station together. At the moment, there are no repair or refueling services available here."
],
[
"Iconil",
"The first crewed interstellar expedition launched by the Avgi entered orbit first around Iconil, rather than the tantalizingly habitable world of Livolua nearby. This seemingly unorthodox decision was made by the ship's crew because of the dwarf planet's combination of low gravity and visible patches of sparkling ice, which offered an easy way to replenish the vessel's propellant. The mission spent several months gathering resources and launching probes before finally crossing the last stretch to settle Livolua: the Avgi's first interstellar colony."
],
[
"Iddesato",
"Iddesato is a considerably large station, at least when compared to a human one, but much of its size can be attributed to the large constructs sticking out of its front, the purpose of which you can only guess at. The rest of the station seems more normal, with a large hangar that acts as the station's spaceport."
],
[
"Iemn Eitch",
"Although too cold for a proper civilization, Iemn Eitch has been extensively used in the past as an outpost for the growing Gegno space race. As one of their first few explored worlds, antique-looking architecture is scattered about the surface and looks significantly different to structures found on Dueyu Eitch, perhaps due to the nature of construction in an unfamiliar environment. A few large shipyard-esque platforms continue to service a small number of still active Gegno generation vessels from times past, presumably at a much slower pace than during the earliest days of their space colonization."

[
"Igna",
"This gas giant has an extremely hot atmosphere due to its proximity to the system's star. The clouds emit a warm, orange glow, enabling good visibility even in deeper layers. Occasional storms break the almost peaceful atmosphere, raging violently but disappearing as quickly as they appeared."

[
"Illbo Avo",
"Illbo Avo is a barren moon with little to no atmosphere, but it is also the only solid ground in this system that isn't prone to sliding out under your feet as a result of volcanism. As such, because of the system's proximity to Paru Paru and to the Korath, the Bunrodea have turned the crust of this small moon into a dense network of subterranean structures with purposes ranging from large ship hangars to factories that pump out military-grade ships and outfits, essentially making it one big war factory."
],
[
"Illbo Elo",
"Illbo Elo is a sparsely populated world, with much of the planet's surface being barely habitable deserts. The climate becomes more temperate as you approach the poles, where most of the population is located. The Bunrodea appear to be constructing entirely new cities within these temperate zones, as evident by the large fleets of freighters bringing supplies to cities of mostly skeletal buildings with exposed foundations and metal beams."

[
"Independance",
"Independance, originally named for a document of emancipation for an ancient nation on old Earth, became of interest to the Confederated Councils when they began to consider plans for a defense against an invasion. One such plan involved deploying \"cloud bunkers\" into the gas giants of the Outer Rim from which an uprising could be staged against a foreign occupier. Independance, given its fitting name and position near Alvorada, was chosen as the testing site for this project."

"Inmost Blue",
"Inmost Blue is an ocean world, one of the first planets that the Kimek settled outside their own solar system. About two billion Kimek live on the low-lying islands and the one major continent, and the shallow ocean regions have been entirely converted into kelp farms. The Kimek take a utilitarian approach to food, and processed seaweed is a nutritious but highly unappetizing staple of their diet."

[
"Into White",
"Formerly a fruitful farming world, this planet is now in the grips of an approaching ice age. The Kimek have chosen to wait it out rather than risking destabilizing the planet's ecosystems by trying to correct the temperature change, and the population has dwindled to less than a billion, mostly living near the equator where the climate is still somewhat temperate."

"Jakobsen",
"Jakobsen is an ocean world with only 6% of its surface above sea level. The land consists almost exclusively of volcanic islands and atolls, as any land not refreshed by plate tectonics is slowly being eroded away by the immense seasonal storms that wreathe the planet."

[
"Janalos",
"From orbit, Janalos is a lush, forested world with a thriving ecosystem, ripe for colonization. It is only from the surface that it becomes apparent that this thriving ecosystem is in fact dominated by a mind-boggling variety of insects, large and small. The bugs are everywhere, permeating every part of the planet, and recent colonization efforts were thrwarted by just how inconvenient they make life on this world. Insecticides are quickly adapted to, eggs and larvae can lie dormant for years before re-emerging, and the swarms of insects devour anything they can sink their chitinous teeth into."

It is also where you will find their major genetic engineering research facilities. These facilities attract the brightest minds in genetic engineering from across all of Bunrodean space, where they work to further their understanding and control over genetics."

"Jupiter",
"Once called the King of the Solar System, Jupiter is just as impressive even considering the variety of gas giants in the galaxy. Its famous Great Red Spot is still well-known by most of humanity, and you make sure to steer clear of it while taking in the rich yellows and browns of the planet's atmosphere."

"Kaeyin",
"The world of Kaeyin now seems to be completely uninhabited, but it hasn't always been like that. Large, empty cities with towers of indescribable design encompass a portion of one single continent. The rest of the land remains almost untouched by anything not native to this planet, as if the buildings were simply lowered down onto the land rather than built up over time."

"Kalakil",
"The view from the surface of this pristine forest moon is nothing short of breathtaking, in equal parts from its natural beauty and the chill of its misty air. Cold glacier streams flow from a chain of tall, jagged mountains that round the entire moon, running through sunset-colored forests that meet the sun each morning tinged with frost."

"Kapnos",
"Kapnos is the heart of one of the most spectacular sights in the Milky Way. The gas giant is composed of largely molecular oxygen, despite the seeming impossibility of such an occurrence in nature. Its abnormally rapid spin, which causes the planet to bulge wildly at the equator, throws oxygen and water vapor off the top of its atmosphere to form the famous Gossamer \"gas torus,\" something that has sparked awe in the entire Avgi civilization from the moment of its discovery."

"Karek Fornati",
"Karek Fornati was once a farming world, before global temperatures began to rise and the overworked farmland slowly deteriorated into deserts. The Korath who remain have dedicated their lives to finding a way to keep the \"sand seas\" from swallowing up the last of the fertile land, but without much success, and there are regions near the equator where sandstorms rage continually and no living things can survive."

"Kasi-Osolaa-Sossa",
"By far the most isolated and remote planet in Successor space, Kasi-Osolaa-Sossa is populated mainly by those who enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with solitude. For the highly familial Successors, this is a relatively small proportion, and consequently the planet only supports around twenty thousand inhabitants, though it has the highest population growth of any planet in Successor space. Most agree that this is a result of disinterest in the sometimes-painful political division of the larger Successor worlds, but it is commonly joked that it is instead a consequence of supposed especially amorous tendencies among the local population."

"Kasichara Fet",
"This planet appears to have suffered irradiation when the neighboring star of Peresedersi went nova. The local flora and fauna are alive but still struggling to recover from the loss. Several large Korath cities remain. It seems that they were not able, or not willing, to evacuate the entire population in time to escape the nova's gamma radiation; sun-bleached bones are scattered in the streets of the largest cities."

[
"Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa",
"Although inhospitable by human standards, the snow-covered Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa falls comfortably within the Successors' tolerances, if on the low end of that range. Beneath the permafrost lie rich deposits of rare earth elements and heavy metals that have supported the highly self-contained economy of House Aqrabe; entire production lines from raw material to final product are contained upon this single planet. Since many of the minerals mined here are integral for the production of the Successors' advanced composite materials, Aqrabe and the other New Houses keep a tight grip here, funneling many of the end products into their shipyards and construction projects."

"While some of the High Houses of the Predecessors managed to immigrate to this star cluster in their political entirety, others collapsed along the way. Some of their former citizens were folded into House Kaatriij, but the rest, the majority, were to temporarily habitate here. Now, many years later, their descendants largely still do."

"Katkradol",
"Katkradol is a large rocky world, what human scientists would call a \"super-Earth.\" Far from the local primary, Katkradol is extremely cold; during the winter its atmosphere condenses in the higher latitudes, where it snows frozen nitrogen. Many of Katkradol's mountains are made mostly of ice, which is strong enough in the extreme cold to stretch upwards for kilometers, even under the high gravity. The roots of these mountains generated some interest in the Avgi scientific community due to the many exotic phases of ice that form under the intense pressures, but Katkradol's deep gravity well made ice mining uncompetitive with comet harvesting in the region."

"Kella-Uuoru-Sossa",
"This planet is an ecological catastrophe. Its surface has been scoured by radiation and by what must have been an orbital bombardment; no organic life remains. Many large cities dot the surface, several of which have been leveled or damaged by weapon strikes, and far more which are nearly entirely intact. All are equally empty. Persistent clouds of caustic dust choke the atmosphere, and your ship's sensors alert you to the presence of several dust storms at other locations on the planet's surface. It would be wise not to get caught in one."

"Kort Kehai",
"This planet has a temperate climate, yet its surface is nearly lifeless, perhaps due in part to the high concentration of radioactive isotopes in the soil. The only plant growing on most of the land is a hardy bioengineered moss designed by the Wanderers to accumulate heavy metals and other toxins in its root system. These plants are then periodically harvested by flocks of unpiloted robots and buried in deep pits near the planet's poles."

"Kort Vek'kri",
"This world is nearly unpopulated, with very little animal life and strange, twisted plants with odd coloration.

"Kuwaru Efreti",
"This Quarg ringworld is almost half completed, but there are no signs of active construction, and your ship's sensors picked up no energy signals from any section of the ring except for this one. You also observed superficial weapon scars on some parts of the ring, damage that the Quarg have not bothered to repair - although clearly the attackers did not possess weapons powerful enough to do any serious harm to the ring."

"The Quarg built this station centuries ago, before they began construction on the ringworld. From the dark side of the station, the ring is visible as a thin bright filament stretching out to either side of the system's sun. The ring itself is closed to human visitors, but tour shuttles depart from here on a regular basis, giving human tourists a closer view of this engineering feat that is so far beyond anything human beings have ever attempted to build."

Built nearly four hundred years ago, the station was one of the first to fuel the massive cargo caravans sent out from the Deep back when this was one of the only regions of the galaxy with a prosperous economy and a democratic government. Today it remains under government control, because the citizens of the Deep are wary of any private corporation controlling the industry that makes interstellar travel possible."

Most of the surface is bone dry, with the only water trapped in a small chain of cold, brackish seas near the equator. Little rain falls outside their drainage basins, but what does is bitter and alkaline. The broken remains of what might have once been cities, worn down to little more than circular arrangements of rubble, hints that there is much history here - but no future."

"Maspa-Viir-Kella",
"This planet is about as large as a terrestrial planet can be before it is considered a gas giant. It is surrounded by an extremely thick atmosphere that is just barely within the tolerances of traditional shipbuilding techniques, which buffets your vessel with high winds before you even make landing. It is hard to see anything at any distance on the ground; the fog is simply too thick."

[
"Mavra-Sol-Kvel",
"This green and well-populated moon enjoys a temperate climate and spectacular vistas, both of its own surface and of the gas giant it orbits. The gravity here is quite low, and the Successors you see here tower over you even more noticeably than on other worlds. There are several cities on the surface, most along the equator."

[
"Mebla's Portion",
"A stormy world with unpredictable and rapidly changing weather, Mebla's Portion is nonetheless home to several billion Arachi and millions of members of the other Coalition species, in part because rent is cheaper here than on worlds with more idyllic weather. Many of the residents are artists or work in other creative fields that allow them to work from home on days when the weather is too violent for them to venture outside."

[
"Melatos",
"Despite being a large rocky world, Melatos lacks all but the thinnest of atmospheres. Avgi astrogeologists have determined that some cataclysmic event millions of years ago melted and quickly refroze the outermost layers of its crust, coinciding with a mass extinction on Aviskir. This rapid cooling created a world with a smooth, marble-like texture, in part made from ceramic. The glassy surface is crazed by deep cracks, formed as the crust refroze and shrank as it cooled."

[
"Melenci",
"While the southern world of Jentu Le is where genetic research is mainly done, the small moon of Melenci here in the north is where much of that research is put to practice. The moon has only one settlement where Bunrodeans come to receive modifications to their genome. However, the Bunrodeans ensure that any modifications that are done will affect only the individual they are being done to, and will not be passed down to any offspring."

[
"Meligara",
"Of the three gas giants that orbit around Ritilas, Meligara is by far the closest to the lavender wormholes. The small distance made it inevitable for the two to influence each other: the gas giant has no major moon, and even its ring visibly tends to incline and become elliptical when the wormhole is at its closest."

[
"Mendez Station",
"Mendez Station is the closest object to Alpherg's twin stars. Constructed by the CCOR as part of its efforts to build self-sufficiency in the Outer Rim, the station's gigantic ramscoops collect charged particles from the system's solar winds and refine them into hyperdrive fuel."

"Mere",
"Mere is a world almost entirely covered by oceans. The locals live most of their lives on enormous ships, almost like floating cities, which travel around collecting fish and seaweed for food or harvesting pearls from the shallows to be sold off-world. The city-ships must do their best to avoid certain latitudes where hurricanes are most common, and even so storms are a continuous threat to anyone who lives here. Weather conditions are tracked constantly by a network of satellites."

"Miblulub's Plenty",
"Miblulub's Plenty was the first colony created by the Arachi outside of their home system, founded at a time when their home world could not produce enough food to reliably feed its entire population. This planet has long seasons and plentiful rainfall that make its temperate zones ideal for farming, while the grasslands near the tropics are mostly used for longcow ranching. Longcows are a distinctive and ill-behaved species of multi-legged cattle; their meat is a key part of the Arach diet."

"Midway Emerald",
"Wealthy Kimek prefer to live as close as possible to the centers of power, and in Coalition space the center of power is the Heliarch ringworlds. The dwellings here are a bit more luxurious and less densely packed than on other Kimek worlds, and the total population is less than two billion. Outside the cities, this is a hot forest world, without much local industry or natural resources."

"Millrace",
"Millrace is an overpopulated world, full of factories and manufacturing plants. It is one of several planets in this region of space where people trying to escape from the crowded squalor and polluted cities of Earth come looking for work. Most of the goods manufactured here end up being used by the Syndicate for constructing starships or driving industry on other worlds."

"Mirrorlake",
"The Hai homeworld is orbited by a moon that is large and dense enough to have been able to hold on to its own supply of surface water, and although the atmosphere is cold, much of that water is in liquid form due to the strong tides. In a few places, granite and basalt cliffs rise out of the water, and the Hai have built a few small settlements on the moon, as well."

"Mnai",
"The environment of this world is quite pleasant by human standards. A majority of Mnai's yearly seasons consist of extended warm summer periods that provide healthy conditions for wildlife to thrive. Canyons are a common sight, sometimes harboring their own smaller ecosystems both in their higher mountainous regions and down in the valleys. Other patches of Mnai's surface have mesas that are home to mammals that look like large bears with antlers."

"Moonshake",
"Moonshake is a planet of overpopulated cities side by side with dense wilderness. A few centuries ago it became a local center of industrial production when the Syndicate began building factories here. Since then, immigrants looking for steady work have been pouring in, doubling the planet's population every few decades. It is now a regional center for the production of everything from textiles to molded plastic parts to reactor-grade plutonium."

"Mordente-Bridi",
"A testament to the ingenuity of the engineering corps of the now defunct Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim, the massive Mordente-Bridi Station is one of the largest in human space. Twin cylinders Mordente and Bridi make up the station's hull, built from the strongest alloy the CCOR could manufacture at scale. Bridi Cylinder is pressurized and contains crew quarters and logistical infrastructure amounting to that of a sizable city, while Mordente Cylinder contains what was the Outer Rim's main shipyard."

"This small planet hosts a population of towering octopus-like aliens. They have built several cities across its surface that are highly symmetrical, filled with organic-looking curved buildings draped in colorful fabrics that shimmer in the light.

"Muspel",
"Muspel is a hot world of deserts, canyons, and warm-water oceans. It is mostly a mining and manufacturing planet, and as a result there are few lifelong inhabitants; most of the people here are migrant workers who are just trying to save up enough money to settle down somewhere more hospitable."
],
[
"Mutiny",
"Centuries ago, Mutiny was used as a sort of prison world for a powerful band of pirates, a place where rivals could be marooned or held for ransom, rather than killing them outright. It is a cold, dark planet, and food is scarce, but over time several villages developed in the more hospitable regions. No longer prisoners, the inhabitants who remain do so because they prefer a simple life beyond the reach of any government, on a planet that will never be stolen from them because it carries nothing of value."

"Myiara-Aret-Iir",
"In contrast to the pristine emptiness of the other formerly-inhabited planets in this area of space, this world teems with signs of chaos. The remains of hastily-built weather-control towers dot much of its surface, and the cities upon it are neither majestic nor well-maintained; none are very large, but most are surrounded by vast expanses of fabric and radiation-bleached temporary constructions."

"Mystery",
"The Saryd culture's fascination with the movement of the stars and planets can perhaps be attributed to the fact that their homeworld is orbited by two moons, which cause a complex and seemingly unpredictable cycle of tides as well as a variety of subtle effects on the circadian rhythms of the creatures that evolved on Saros. Saryd homes on other worlds often have night lighting cycles designed to mimic the moons of their homeworld."

"Naph-Naap-Kella",
"This planet is deep in the throes of its early history, with a thick sulfurous atmosphere concealing an unstable and volcanically active surface. Mineral-rich pools simmer next to lava flows and crumbling ejecta, and the atmosphere is repeatedly lit up by enormous cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges that leave the hull of your ship crackling with static electricity."

[
"Naphir",
"Naphir was the chosen destination, and ultimately the final resting place, of an ill-fated early interstellar expedition. The Avgi pioneers who volunteered for the mission knew well in advance that the system lacked any garden planets, but set out regardless; all of them were well prepared to spend the rest of their lives in orbital stations. Finding a cool, airless moon around a gas giant, the colonists settled down and began constructing habitats and gathering essential resources."

"Nasqueron",
"Beneath Nasqueron's cloudy surface is a complex and thriving ecosystem of gas-dwelling organisms, from the massive void sprites all the way down to bacteria that inhabit tiny water droplets suspended in the air. Although the void sprites mostly feed on these organisms, it appears that in order to grow into their adult form or to give birth to young, they also need rare minerals that they can only find by feeding on asteroids, far beyond the planet's atmosphere."

"Navigeo Yards",
"Navigeo is a station designed to be a dedicated shipyard, with dozens of modular dry docks capable of quickly laying down new ships or repairing damaged ones. Overall, almost all of the large warships in service of the Twilight Guard are built here, though efforts are being made to decentralize warship production for the sake of survivability."

"Nepheritis",
"An unusually large ice giant, Nepheritis is well-known among the denizens of the Paradise Planets for its prodigious rains of large diamonds. While this phenomenon is common on most ice giants of sufficient size, Nepheritis is a scientific curiosity due to the sheer size of the diamonds formed in its atmosphere, with some even becoming large boulders during their plummet into the depths."

"Neriene",
"While lacking its iconic ferrous-red color, this planet is eerily similar in conditions to the second planet humanity set foot on, Mars. The thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the polar ice caps, and the echoes of dried waterways across the surface all tell the tragic tale of the same fate that befell Mars in eons past."

"Nimbus",
"Nimbus is a stormy ocean world, where a rain shower can descend on you almost without warning, only to be replaced with equal suddenness by bright sunshine. It draws mostly the sort of people who can weather such changes with placid, unperturbed calm; tourist guidebooks often rank Nimbus near the top in their lists of \"friendliest natives.\""

"Nisos Cylinder",
"The Nisos Cylinder was once a huge habitat station, of the same type as the O'Neil Cylinder concept from Earth's 20th century. With a population of nearly twelve million, Nisos was one of nearly a thousand cylinders created by the Avgi, mostly in the Anax system, where they were together home to billions. As the Aberrant advanced across Avgi space, it was evacuated in a frenzy that saw most of its population flee to Aviskir. Compared to its neighbors, it is relatively intact, and still holds an atmosphere."
],
[
"Noluc",
"Even if it was something other than a lifeless, metal-poor desert planet, Noluc would have a hard time attracting settlers. The angry red-orange color that coats the planet's sandy wastes is actually created by a simple neurotoxin lethal to both humans and Avgi. While technically harmless in its dry state, any exposure to water will dissolve the dust into solution, rendering it into a potent poison capable of killing with even microscopic doses."
],
[
"Norn",
"Norn is a water world, with low gravity but an atmosphere dense enough to breathe easily. Large mats of seaweed and algae form natural rafts that drift around with the ocean currents, and a few intrepid settlers have colonized them, people who prefer a life of relative solitude and are willing to trust their fates to wherever the winds might take them. Others have settled the few, low islands, which are prone to frequent flooding."

"O-Vasa-Oa",
"This binary planet is the collective seat of what are known as the New Houses, the noble families who traveled through the wormhole to this region of space during the collapse of the Predecessors' empire. Many within the New Houses object to that moniker, arguing that their family lines are in fact the more extensive and noble and that they should be categorized by that, rather than their time of arrival."

"Occupas",
"There are no places to land on this planet, so you end up simply gliding through the upper layers of clouds. From time to time giant shadows appear in the deeper layers, but they never stay long. This gas giant has relatively calm weather; the winds are mild and storms do not appear very often."

[
"Ochrescoop",
"A massive plaque attached to a bulkhead in the promenade entry proudly indicates that station has been run by Yoot Ki Magnetic Fuel Harvesting for over 75,000 years. It seems that the powerful magnetic field of the gas giant below makes this station an ideal location for harvesting and re-harvesting the massive volume of fuel demanded by the Hai space industry. Despite its long history of operation, the station seems to be in an excellent state of repair."

"Ogmur",
"Beneath Ogmur's oppressive gravity, churning blue and yellow cyclones weave, merge, and split in an eternal dance, violent green flashes illuminating turbulent depths. The planet is dominated by a titan storm that spans a third of the visible globe, the most intense in all of Coalition space - and the reason why Coalition activity is concentrated on the planet's other, much calmer hemisphere."
],
[
"Ogmur's Siphon",
"This refinery was built shortly after the nearby dry dock station was finished, to ensure the system was self-sufficient to provide the hyperspace fuel needed for the visiting ships. A small fleet of tanker ships is docked on specially marked hangar bays, always ready to bring the fuel elsewhere if needed."

[
"Okoity",
"Due to an overabundance of natural resources and arable land when the planet was discovered, Okoity has achieved the highest population of any Bunrodean world, with a staggering 24 billion people. All but the most inhospitable regions of the planet have been settled in some shape or form."
],
[
"Olohoa",
"From afar, Olohoa looks like it might be a pleasant place to live, with clear oceans not too dissimilar to what you might find on a Paradise World. But your ship's sensors tell you a different story, one of a planet with immense amounts of ultraviolet radiation bombarding its surface. Nothing short of an extremophile could survive on the surface here, and any life in the oceans is likely deep down where no radiation can reach."
],
[
"Omanet",
"Omanet is thought to be a chthonian world, a former gas giant whose atmosphere was stripped away until the rocky core was left bare. For whatever reason, Omanet went a step further, and its silicate crust and mantle were also boiled off. Left behind was a dense world made almost entirely out of metal, captured around Avalet as a large moon."
],
[
"Orodens",
"This moon is speculated to have once been much larger, until some event stripped it of its crust and mantle. Now, only the metal-rich core remains, serving as an alluring target abundant in heavy elements. More recently, Orodens is thought to have supported a hydrological cycle for a brief period, creating rich veins of precipitated minerals. However, the high surface gravity made it costly to transport material off the surface and to other systems. Rows of mass drivers were used to fire refined minerals into orbit, where they could be collected by waiting ships."

[
"Osaeli",
"An Earth-like planet with high biodiversity, at first glance Osaeli appears to be an idyllic world where no lifeform ever became predominant; but looking more closely, the signs of an ancient devastation can still be seen. In the middle of the forests, huge amounts of debris are scattered across large areas, and scans reveal many underground bunkers, partly destroyed and filled with water."

[
"Osolaa-Val-Mavra",
"This moon is covered in a constant veil of frost that coats the sparse and hardy vegetation on its surface in delicate ice crystals. On the side of the moon that faces its parent gas giant, a massive circular trench, kilometers-deep, has been carved into the earth. Within it, huge terraced complexes have been built into the walls; empty residential areas, shipyards, and public spaces jut into the trench's open air where they are adorned by the constant snowfall."

[
"Oup Je",
"The many beveling formations here provide the Gegno Scin with a rich amount of materials for their cities and ships. Below are small woodlands that seem to be stripped down one way or another, with few living areas scattered about. It is apparent that this planet has been worn down over time, due to both natural and unnatural causes."
],
[
"Oura",
"Oura is the largest and fastest rotating gas giant in the Anax system, with an extensive system of moons rich in mineral wealth. The planet itself is immense, but has an unusually low density for a gas planet of its size. Large quantities of nitrogen, sulfides, and ammonia give it a ruddy color tinged with a blue-white glow, with wavy bands folding over each other as they ripple with the winds."
],
[
"Outpost Alkos",
"Predating the Incursion, Outpost Alkos was the first major refueling station built in the Tangled Shroud. While it continues to harvest deuterium and helium-3 from the gas giant below, it has largely been supplanted by smaller, less centralized ice-based deuterium refineries. This has led to a degree of neglect by the Assembly, and a posting here is generally regarded as a minor punishment."
],
[
"Outpost Enka",
"Outpost Enka is a huge station built between two large asteroids, which are steadily being mined for the metals and minerals they contain. Most of the habitat is freestanding, mounted on the spar that links both asteroids, but one asteroid is also riddled with pressurized tunnels and pockets filled with farms and open green spaces."
],
[
"Outpost Leto",
"Outpost Leto is one of the most recent constructions in the Tangled Shroud, built into a Kuiper belt object far from its primary. Large inflated domes, housing those unfortunate enough to be stationed here, dot an icy surface slathered in reddish tholins and chunks of frozen hydrocarbons. It is these very hydrocarbons and organic compounds that Outpost Leto was built to mine, shipping them in bulk to stations in the Outer Limits to support their environmental systems and ecosystems."
],
[
"Outpost Pilos",
"Outpost Pilos is a large early warning station set up soon after the Avgi decided to settle beyond the Tangled Shroud. Fearful of the Aberrant managing to overcome their supposed aversion to the mazelike region of space, it was quickly decided that a tripwire would be needed to warn of an incursion in the event of the fall of the Feo Platform and the infestation of the Tangled Shroud with Aberrations. However, when a large-scale attack never materialized, Outpost Pilos quickly found a second use as an intermediary waystation for the trade of minerals from the Tangled Shroud with the settlements beyond it."

"Outpost Tekis",
"Outpost Tekis is a station built into an enormous asteroid, with tunnels and habitats throughout its entire volume. Its surface is littered with pressurized tubes and habitat domes, many of which grow massive amounts of food in farms and gardens."

[
"Palarei",
"While its short distance from Gerenus makes it seem only barely capable of supporting life, Palarei's surface is full of thickets of a small spiky bush native to this planet. Oddly enough, very few settlements on the planet appear to have been destroyed by weapons fire; most facilities are covered in meters of dust and sand but, other than that, appear to be quite operative."
],
[
"Palatine",
"The whipping winds of Palatine are a prime example of how the inner mechanics of gas giants are poorly understood; when it was initially discovered by the Remnant, its winds spun around the globe at speeds far in excess of what astrophysical models predicted, as if they had recently been subject to a massive acceleration."
],
[
"Palos",
"A cool desert world, Palos hosts a surface temperature suitable for habitation, but an unbreathable carbon dioxide atmosphere and deep gravity well has precluded any large scale settlement here. Had it been present in the Anax system, it very likely would have been an attractive target for terraforming, but with the natural beauty of nearby Cyreal free for the taking the Avgi of the Thread system declined to spend their scarce resources on the comparatively barren Palos."
],
[
"Parii'het",
"Very similar to its sister station of Seli'het, Parii'het was still under construction when it was abandoned by its creators. Today, it floats uninhabited in this rarely visited section of space, approached occasionally by the automated drones that mindlessly continue to carry new supplies to the massive cargo section. If the Ka'het attacked this station, it would be made entirely inoperable in a short time."
],
[
"Passaritus",
"Decades ago, Passaritus was the subject of an ambitious project by the Deep to mine metallic hydrogen from its mantle. Being barely large enough to form metallic hydrogen in the first place, the gas giant's gravity was thought to be low enough to make extraction feasible. Unfortunately, the Deep had overestimated their ability to build an extraction device that was not only functional, but economical, and the project has since been moved to the backburner."

"Pathera",
"The planet's upper bands contain an unusually high concentration of rainbow-hued micrometeoroids, leaving ghostly trails in their wake. Rising thermal columns glow in a delicate pink as they carry some of the debris upwards."

[
"Pearl",
"Pearl is an idyllic, forested world, mostly set aside as a wildlife sanctuary for imported exotic species. Each of the islands and continents houses animals and plants from a different planet's biosphere. Terraforming stations and satellites maintain the atmospheric gas levels in order to keep each island at the proper temperature and rainfall level."
],
[
"Pelubta Station",
"Pelubta Station was built shortly after the Arachi discovered the hyperdrive, initially to take advantage of the massive amounts of solar power generated by the nearby stars. However, now it is mainly used as a hyperspace fuel refinery. Although it has endured some solar flares, constant maintenance means that the station still doesn't show its age."
],
[
"Periaxle Circuit",
"The first structure of such scale the Coalition ever built, this station was designed and fully built before the War of Independence. Originally a Saryd attempt at emulating the Quarg's own ringworlds, almost all living quarters and amenities were stripped away over the course of the war in favor of a gigantic particle accelerator used by the Saryds to research weapons and shielding technology. Nowadays, its use has shifted into a more general-purpose research facility."
],
[
"Peripheria",
"This enormous, kilometer-wide rotating station is the capital of the Avgi civilization in exile. Shaped like a solid disc, it is home to almost a million Avgi, made up of both civilians that were able to flee the core worlds during the invasion and those who already led independent lives in deep space."
],
[
"Phoenix Station",
"As with all refineries in the Deep, Phoenix Station is government-owned. You cannot imagine who would want to live here; despite reflective hull plating and active cooling systems, the station is uncomfortably hot. Nearly all the work is done by robots and computers, with only a skeleton crew of people supervising. Every time the station's orbit brings it through the planet's shadow, the temperature drops briefly and the entire station creaks ominously as it cools."
],
[
"Pil",
"This airless moon is notable only for its rich deposits of light elements such as lithium and phosphorus. Their concentration was high enough to economically justify bringing them up out of the moon's gravity well, instead of simply mining the carbonaceous asteroids present in the system."
],
[
"Pilot",
"Pilot is used as a research and testing station for Lovelace Labs. The research buildings are not open to non-employees. From a distance it looks almost like a small war is going on, with missiles being fired from a silo toward a hilltop where an anti-missile turret is picking them off one by one."
],
[
"Pincian",
"Pincian is a small rocky moon, tiny enough to avoid most asteroids attracted by the nearby gas giant of Palatine. Nevertheless, a huge crater, old enough to have collected some dust and regolith, dominates its surface. Whatever crashed here, it must be tens of thousands of years since the impact."
],
[
"Placatious",
"Half a century ago, Placatious was the subject of a Syndicate marketing campaign, advertising the view of its deep blue sky from orbit to be \"the most agreeable sight in the galaxy.\" Construction on a large station, intended to be a massive hub of conference rooms with panoramic views of the supposedly breathtaking gas giant below, was started but never completed after numerous delays and budget overruns. Eventually, the executive responsible for the entire scheme was forced into an early retirement, and the idea was quietly dropped."

[
"Placer",
"Placer is uninhabited aside from one small mining outpost; the atmosphere contains uncomfortable levels of ammonia and sulfur dioxide. To avoid respiratory injury from long term exposure, those who live here must wear breathing gear when they leave their pressurized homes and mine shafts."

[
"Plort's Water",
"Plort's Water is an ocean world, with no landforms except for some scattered volcanic archipelagos. A few of the larger islands are home to small Arach settlements, and others live aboard \"island-ships\" that can each carry tens of thousands of individuals. There is very little industry here, but many of the locals are involved in biological experiments or in categorizing the millions of species that inhabit the oceans."
],
[
"Poisonwood",
"Until very recently, Poisonwood was home to a slave colony run by a powerful outlaw cartel. Tens of thousands of slaves were forced to work in hot, dirty manufacturing plants or irrigating fields out under the burning sun. Finally, in the year 2985, a Republic Navy strike force defeated the cartel and liberated the slaves. The Navy also supplied the manpower and equipment necessary to transform the factories and towns into a more livable setting for those who chose to remain, while giving others free passage off-world."

[
"Pon'tes",
"Pon'tes is uncomfortable, even by the standards of a station. As the Incipias are able to propel themselves through the air, there are no handles or surfaces for you to grip onto. The simulated gravity caused by the rotation of the station is not helping."

[
"Poseidos",
"Poseidos is an ocean world, speckled with tiny islands. The people who live on the islands almost all make a living by fishing. The oceans are so bountiful that the locals say that only a fool or a very lazy person would starve here; there are enough fish even near shore that most families just own a small boat rather than the larger vessels designed for the deep ocean."

[
"Prime",
"Prime is a very Earth-like ocean world, with a population of over a billion people. It is home to Betelgeuse Shipyards, and much of the industry on the planet is related to ship-building in one way or another, like refining and working metal, or developing exotic new hull and framing materials. Although some mining is done in more remote regions of the planet, Prime is reliant on shipments of metal and other goods to feed its industries."

"Pugglemug",
"This planet appears to be the Pug capital. Cities with impossibly high towers, connected by arches and bridges, are sprinkled across the landscape, and surrounding the cities are shorter, uglier buildings used as factories. However, a surprising amount of the land area is unsettled, its natural beauty untouched. Given how much damage humans did to Earth before discovering the hyperdrive, you find it hard to fathom how a species isolated in a single star system could have enough restraint to leave their home so pristine."

"Pugglequat",
"This planet has a handful of Pug cities on it, full of tall, graceful spires and arches. However, most of the land area is either left in its natural state, or in use for mining; it seems to abound in both oil reserves and metal ore. The climate is somewhat cold by human standards, but still quite livable. You are not sure if that is because the Pug were just lucky enough to have a star system with two hospitable planets, or whether they have employed some sort of terraforming."

"Pyriphlegethon",
"Despite its poorly received name, Pyriphlegethon was famous in the early history of human interstellar travel as the first \"hot Jupiter\" to be explored in detail. Colorful images of its incandescent clouds and glowing night sky became some of the most iconic images of space in the 23rd century, when the invention of the hyperdrive was still recent."

"Quirinal",
"While otherwise resembling a fairly typical moon, Quirinal is notable for the lava rifts that seem to be an inexplicably constant feature on its surface. For lack of a better description, it looks like the moon was struck a glancing blow by some sort of massive force, and the resulting chasm has been oozing lava ever since."

"Raaqa-Puan-Uuoru",
"After the collapse, many Successors found themselves without a family, or without the knowledge of unbroken lineage that others took comfort in. House Kaatrij, which had lost many of its scions in the collapse, took the previously unprecedented step of welcoming these otherwise-outcasts into its familial order, earning a reputation as the most diverse of the various Houses. Many of its members still pledge a ceremonial allegiance to their defunct Houses under Kaatrij, which remains small but well-supported and a key member of the New Houses alliance."

"Raaqa-Uur-Kaav",
"Unlike most of the planets in this area of space, this moon remains relatively habitable. Large forests have flourished throughout it in the absence of sapient life, and the stark remains of abandoned cities are slowly being reclaimed by the nature that surrounds them. While the materials which compose the buildings have not decayed an iota over the eons, the tender shoots of green life nonetheless adhere to their twisting surfaces and flourish within their unmaintained interiors."

"Refuge of Belugt",
"Billions of Arachi live on this warm ocean world. It is home to House Debdo, one of the largest of the great Arach houses, which is composed of those who are employed in various service industries. This is a popular tourist destination not just for the Arachi, but for the Kimek as well and even a few particularly adventuresome Saryds."

"Relic",
"Relic was colonized over seven hundred years ago, back when the construction of the first hyperdrive was still in living memory. At this point, most starships had a very limited range, so the stars adjacent to Earth were the only viable options for any colonization attempts. Because of this, Relic seemed like it was going to become a major colony, despite its low gravity, harsh environment, and limited resources."

"Remote Blue",
"Most Kimek are proud to be members of the Coalition, but those who are either suspicious of the other species or simply want to be as far away from the Heliarch ringworlds as possible when the Quarg return with retribution, choose to live here. As a result, despite its remote location this world supports a population of over eight billion. Many of the cities have defensive gun emplacements on their outskirts, yet another sign of the local paranoia."

[
"Retilie",
"Retilie is an oceanic world; more than 95% of the planet's surface is covered by oceans, which can be several kilometers deep. Few traces of coastal villages are still visible, mostly composed of ancient metallic formations standing some kilometers from the seaside, where the occasional high waves can't reach them. A few small cities on the mainland are in a better state, but without anyone to maintain them, vegetation has grown to completely cover many of the surviving buildings."

"Revelation",
"The Saryds are the only known species who successfully visited another world when their technology was still in the age of steam. The scientist who first landed here was piloting a ramshackle rocket ship of dizzying complexity. Modern analysis of his plans indicates that his flight had less than a one in ten thousand chance of success. This has led to speculation that he was either secretly assisted by friendly aliens, completely insane, or possibly both."

"Ring of Friendship",
"This is the crown jewel of the Heliarchs, a ringworld that was completed by the Quarg before the Coalition formed and drove them away. It now serves both as a center of finance and trade, and as the seat of the Heliarch government, which is made up of \"consuls\" who have been selected by the other Heliarchs from among their number in such a way that all three species always have equal representation. The Heliarchs, in turn, are selected from among the best and brightest members of each species. Despite the occasional resistance to it, this meritocracy has survived ten times longer than any human democracy."

"Ring of Power",
"This ringworld is the center of operations for the Heliarch defense forces. Although they have not had to fight a major space battle in thousands of years, they still maintain a sizable fleet, believing that if they ever allow their vigilance to waver, the Quarg may return and try to reclaim what was once theirs."

"Rolion",
"At some point in the recent past, Rolion had a close encounter with another massive planet - potentially another gas giant, which was subsequently ejected from the Mellow system. Whatever the details, the encounter tipped Rolion on its side and completely upturned its atmosphere, creating wildly surging swells and storms larger than most terrestrial planets. The gravitational interaction between the two planets also heated the gas giant quite significantly, and in the infrared spectrum Rolion glows brightly."

But over thousands of years, they have returned significant portions of the planet to their original wilderness state.

"Some recent event, natural or artificial, disrupted the rings around Sebarep Atarkis to the point of their complete instability. Now, hundreds of ringroids fall into the planet's atmosphere each day, tracing fiery paths in the planet's skies. This has measurably increased the temperature in the equatorial region, directly below the rings, and new storms and wind patterns are generated chaotically in the wake of their passage."

Above ground, only a few species of birds and insects are able to survive."

"A hideously powerful weapon tore open scars on this planet's surface so deep that pools of magma bled out through them. Presumably these wounds were inflicted on the planet by yet another Korath super-weapon devised in the final years of their civil war. A few ruined cities remain, some of which were sliced in two by the trail of weapons fire."

"Sela",
"A former planetoid captured into Aviskir's orbit only a few hundred million years ago, Sela is unusual for large moons in that it is not tidally locked, instead having a rapid rotational period of only forty-two hours. Almost one third of the moon is covered in a glassy plain of ice, smoothed by seasonal melting and refreezing. This is thought to have been deposited by a cometary impact relatively recently, and has been steadily sublimating away into space ever since."

"Serpens is a sparsely populated world of ancient canyonlands and barren deserts. There were no permanent settlements here until a century ago when visiting biologists discovered an indigenous snake whose venom is useful as a painkiller and heart medication.

"Sestor Ikfar",
"This dry, hot world is home to almost no native life, but is ideal for the Korath automata because of its abundant solar energy. In the places where the Korath cities once were, the Kor Sestor have built massive factories with buildings sometimes close to a kilometer in height. In other places the land remains undeveloped, but the factories are constantly expanding outward."

"Setar Fort",
"There are several large Korath cities on this planet, but the ones farther from the equator have been covered by encroaching glaciers as the planet slowly enters a new ice age. A small number of crops are still grown in the open air, but many of the fields have now been covered with row upon row of gleaming glass as the Korath resort to greenhouse farming to lengthen the growing season and feed their remaining population more efficiently. Farther from the city, Korath ranchers tend herds of creatures that resemble giant, six-legged yaks."

[
"Shadow of Leaves",
"Saryds are particularly drawn to forested environments, and as a result this world has become heavily populated. Rather than gathering in tightly packed cities with skyscrapers and busy roads, they have spread out evenly across the whole land area in a sort of endless suburban sprawl. But enough patches of forest have been maintained between the roads and housing compounds that from orbit, at a first glance, the planet looks pristine and uninhabited."

"Shadowed Valley",
"A dizzying variety of bizarre and stunted life forms have evolved on Shadowed Valley, each with different means of coping with the high levels of sulfuric acid in the planet's atmosphere and rainwater. In the mountains where cliffs and rocks are exposed to the acid rain, they have been sculpted into smooth, flowing contours etched with lines and wrinkles. But the Saryds prize this planet primarily for the beauty of its gypsum caves, full of delicate crystalline deposits, towering speleothems, and deep, clear pools of poisonous water."

"Shangri-La",
"Named after a mythical paradise, Shangri-La is an almost ideal planet, with a mixture of advanced, developed cities and uninhabited mountains. It is a rich and prosperous world, and nearly self-sufficient, but the cost of living here is prohibitively high for anyone from off-world. Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves."
],
[
"Shassa-Wyra-Orrou",
"Despite its favorable location in Successor space, Shassa-Wyra-Orrou is only sparsely inhabited: the hot stars it orbits make its surface temperature a little too warm for most Successors. Even so, there are some small settlements in the polar regions, mostly populated by mining families taking advantage of the rich mineral wealth of both the planet and the surrounding system."
],
[
"Shifting Sand",
"This world is dry, but not particularly hot. The settlements are small and scattered, because each oasis only provides enough water for a few thousand individuals. Some of them focus on manufacturing, while others are attempting to farm the desert with drought-resistant crops. But the largest industry is retirement housing: the cool, dry climate and slow, quiet pace of life here are exactly what elderly Saryds find most comfortable."
],
[
"Shih's Locker",
"This gas giant earned its name after the infamous Captain Shih \"disposed\" of a mutiny. Rather than simply ejecting her crew out of the airlock, she packed them into an escape pod that would survive the upper atmosphere of the planet. In the years that followed, many seeking to prove themselves the meanest pirate in the galaxy sought to emulate her example by making a pilgrimage to her Locker whenever a crew member went too far out of line."
],
[
"Shiver",
"Shiver is a dead and frozen world. The only settlement is a small refueling station that services cargo fleets on their way to Earth. Precipitation is rare here, but sometimes the wind whips up snow and ice from the surface into something akin to a desert sandstorm, and even on days when the wind dies down the air sparkles with tiny, floating ice crystals."

[
"Shorebreak",
"Shorebreak is an ocean world which is home to a stunning profusion of alien life, some of which is not too dissimilar from life on Earth. The first settlement, centuries ago, was built as a marine biology laboratory, and from there the planet gradually grew into a regional center for bioengineering, where local life forms are tested for possible use in human medicine."

[
"Shroud",
"Shroud is a world of castles in the clouds and slums in the valleys below. High on the mountain peaks, above the clouds, the planet's few elites live in splendid mansions. Below them, the people work mostly in textiles: farming cotton, raising sheep, working at looms and sewing machines in dimly lit factories."
],
[
"Siedi",
"The gravitational pull of the nearby gas giant gave rise to the large, bulky, mountainous surface of this planet. Tectonic shifts are very common, and the surface is marked with the wear and tear of massive tremors. Beneath the cracks, however, lies a rich source of materials that the Vi quickly capitalized on for their nearby worlds."

[
"Silo of Ablodab",
"First built by the Heliarchs mere centuries after their victory over the Quarg, this station serves as both a control point for the automated strip mines on the planet below and a smeltery to process all the raw materials brought up into the finest alloy platings. First used to produce many of the components of the two other stations in the system, the Silo now serves as a factory for spare ship parts in order to aid the local dry dock's repair functionalities when required. Within restricted sections under constant Heliarch patrol, the station features a few massive, warehouse-like rooms, where the surplus platings are stored."

"Silwan",
"Silwan is a wet, misty world shrouded in a permanent blanket of fog, which covers the entire planet year-round. The little light that makes it to the surface reveals a bleak landscape, eroded to a nearly uniform flatness from the eons of constant rains. Only at the equator is the layer of fog burned off by sunlight, feeding humid forests of fern-like trees."

"Sinter",
"Sinter is a world where life never developed; the atmosphere is unbreathable, but warm enough and dense enough that people can survive here in pressurized homes or outside when wearing oxygen tanks. The only industry here is mining, which is mostly done with remotely controlled robots, so the population of the entire planet is only a few thousand people."

"Siteria",
"An Earth-like planet, Siteria is notable for the large number of settlements on it: every few kilometers there are remains of sizable villages, some of which still haven't been completely covered by vegetation even today. A few cities even have tall buildings still partially held together, a testament to how durable the constructions of the planet's original inhabitants were."
],
[
"Skillet",
"Skillet is a sparsely populated planet whose red hills and canyonlands are strip mined for placer deposits of iron ore and precious metals, mostly to supply the needs of the shipyards in Betelgeuse. This world is also used for ranching, and even for growing corn in a few less arid regions. The weather is usually quite mild, although hot and dry; the only reasons so few people have settled here are because it is so remote, and because the mining and farming industries need far fewer human workers than machines."

"Skyfarm",
"Due to the low gravity here, some of the alien crops planted by the Hai grow to heights of five meters or more. The air is too thin for humans or Hai to breathe without carrying supplemental oxygen tanks, so the population is very small."

[
"Skymoot",
"The \"dragons\" of Skymoot are an immensely popular tourist attraction, unlike their mythical namesakes only in their lack of ability to breathe fire. The presence of such an efficient apex predator has spurred the evolution of a stunning variety of defense mechanisms in its prey, as well; whether in the air or in the plains or deep in the forest, Skymoot is a dangerous place to visit."

[
"Slylandro",
"Far beneath the swirling blue surface of Slylandro's atmosphere, void sprites and other strange creatures float about. As improbable as it may seem, the void sprites must have somehow evolved the capability to manipulate gravity fields, because every once in a while one of them will rise up from the surface powered by an antigravity field similar to the landing repulsors used by human ships. When they do so, the decrease in atmospheric pressure causes them to nearly double in size."

[
"Smuggler's Den",
"Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. But, it has since been taken over by pirates, who turned it into a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. As a hub of pirate activity, Smuggler's Den has access to fenced goods from beyond the region, resulting in repair shops that can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship. This confluence also provides the opportunity to buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners. Rumor has it that pilots with the right connections may be able to purchase heavily modified ships here."

[
"Snowfeather",
"Snowfeather is a world with unusually chaotic weather patterns, where snow can fall even in the middle of summer but will melt away within days when the temperature shifts and becomes warmer again. Surprisingly, it is a popular vacation spot for the Hai, who find the unpredictability and occasional violence of the weather here to be invigorating."

[
"Solima Skarati",
"The Korath were endlessly creative in devising new weapons of war during the twilight years of their empire, but what destroyed this planet in the end was not a military disaster but an ecological one. Small villages along the ocean shores and rusting fleets of boats bear witness to the fact that this ocean world was once a fruitful fishery. But now the ocean carries high levels of industrial toxins, and in place of large fish only small invertebrates remain."
],
[
"Sopi Lefarkata",
"This is a cold and mountainous world, and most of its oceans are covered in ice. A handful of giant craters gouged out from the sides of mountains are the only sign that there were once Korath settlements here. But, the Kor Sestor robots have begun building settlements of their own, in caverns deep under the mountains where they are safe from orbital bombardment. Where recent Kor Mereti attacks have collapsed one of the access tunnels, swarms of robots have gathered to dig them out like ants when their hill has been stepped on."

[
"Sopoyra",
"Sopoyra is a major manufacturing planet, as well as the chokepoint between the Megasa systems of the north and the Erabu systems of the south. Given that royal permission is required to enter the Erabu region, this world also acts as the focal point for trade between the two regions. Goods are dropped off from other Megasa worlds, then transported to the Erabu worlds by freighters with royal permission."
],
[
"Spec Inci",
"This small moon seems to be used mainly as a shipment and processing base, run with the typical efficiency of the Quarg. You wouldn't have even noticed the freighters dropping off large amounts of raw ore for processing if it were not for their large size, as they are surprisingly silent when working. Other ships load the processed materials and fly away."
],
[
"Spera Anatrusk",
"This is a relatively dry planet, and the only Korath cities were close to the poles where the temperatures are more mild and the lifeless deserts give way to grasslands and even a few scattered forests. The largest city was clearly destroyed by orbital bombardment. The other cities seem to have been done in by rioting or looting, leaving smashed windows and burned-out buildings behind. Some of the damage is very recent; the Korath survivors here held out for a long time."
],
[
"Spiraling Indigo",
"Spiraling Indigo is the heaviest gas giant in Coalition space, exceeded only by stars and ringworlds. While the Kimek certainly didn't shy away from harvesting the plentiful resources to be found here, the planet has had much more of a cultural footprint than an economic one. The perpetual storms surrounding the poles here have inspired many Kimek artists, be they writers, stylists, musicians, or painters. The world's popularity in Kimek media has even prompted some religious institutions to claim its beauty as a divine signal."
],
[
"Splashdown",
"Splashdown is an aging world where plate tectonics have long since died down and the weather has worn the surface down into lowlands, marshes, and shallow seas. Most of the land area is not suitable for growing anything but rice, and only a few settlements have been built here."
],
[
"Ssil Vida",
"The silence of this station rings in your ears, and as you explore you are increasingly surprised that it even has an atmosphere. It is obviously ancient, and patches of ambiguous green and purple material resembling fungus grow through the walls. Whoever built this station designed it for beings much larger than you. Either that, or they liked spacious environments. Even the shortest doorway you pass through is easily double your height. They are always wider than they are tall."
],
[
"Staja-Kella-Oa",
"The easternmost planet in Successor space, Staja-Kella-Oa is mostly covered in dense forest with only a few small cities. The planet hosts at least one academy under the auspices of the noble House Sioeora. Further from your landing site, there is evidence of ongoing archaeological work."

"Starcross",
"Starcross is a stormy, ocean-dappled planet that was not settled until the planets farther out on this arm of the galaxy grew prosperous enough to create a need for a stop-over point for cargo. Structures must be built strong and on high enough ground to avoid the frequent floods."
],
[
"Starting Rubin",
"Starting Rubin was far from being the first station constructed around the Kimek homeworld, but it is the oldest one to still be in orbit. It was built as an orbital equivalent to the hunger towers found on the planet it orbits, as a safety measure against the disasters that may affect Ki Patek Ka."
],
[
"Station Cian",
"Cian Station orbits a large gas giant, which simultaneously has compounds usable in hyperspace fuel and enough mass to pull an abnormally large numbers of asteroids near it. The local industry mostly centers around the metals harvested here, but part of it is still focused on refining deuterium. Its remote location prevents it from becoming a major port, but most traders that travel into this region stop here, even if just to refuel and to watch its impressive facilities. This is also the most recent Coalition station, although it's much older than any in human space."

[
"Steamwater",
"Steamwater is a hot Neptune, a misleadingly named \"ice giant\" close to its parent star. Steamwater is distinctive in that, by mass, it is almost entirely water. Beyond this, the range of temperatures and pressures found in its atmosphere is such that its thickest layer is composed of supercritical water, a phase state blending together the states of vapor and liquid, making flight inside it rather disorienting."
],

"Stilacrest is a warm world, with its shallow freshwater seas, pleasant weather, and white limestone cliffs making it an ideal vacation world to any human. The mountain-born Avgi, however, were rather discomforted by its relatively flat landscape and sluggish winds, and permanent settlement has been sparse."

"Stonebreak",
"Stonebreak is home to some of the largest cities in Hai space aside from their homeworld: massive planned communities built in concentric rings, where housing space and community buildings alternate with zones of factories and shipyards. This star system has an unusual number of metallic asteroids, which the Hai harvest for the raw materials for Stonebreak's industries."

[
"Stormhold",
"Stormhold is a cold planet, with a dense, foggy atmosphere. As with many pirate outposts, Stormhold is home to an unknown number of villages and hidden outposts, each controlled by a different pirate faction. It is also said that some of the most dangerous fugitives in the galaxy live deep in the forests of this planet, escaping detection by living underground or by avoiding the use of electronic devices."
],
[
"Stronghold of Flugbu",
"The Stronghold of Flugbu was used as a military base during the War of Independence. Now it is a manufacturing world, specializing not in large machines but small, intricate components. It is also home to House Bebliss, the secretive guild that specializes in communication, translation, and encryption. House Bebliss is essential to the Coalition economy because they maintain the hyperspace communication network, but there are also rumors that they may have ties to the Lunarium."

[
"Sundive",
"Sundive is largely covered in tropical rainforests and savanna, but with enough open plains that it has also become a major agricultural world. For most of the year, the weather here is quite mild, but tornadoes and massive thunderstorms are not uncommon in the summer months."
],
[
"Sundrinker",
"Most of this world is barren deserts and oceans; for whatever reason almost no life evolved here. The only human settlement is a small town in one of the few hilly regions, and the locals survive by ranching and farming. It is the sort of world that is ideal for people who enjoy being alone, because it has almost no appeal for anyone else. In addition to the oppressively hot weather, flash floods are quite frequent."

[
"Taylor",
"Taylor is home to a large astronomical laboratory, with radio telescopes and other devices for studying the galactic core and the massive black hole that resides there. Because of the laboratory, Taylor has strict landing protocols that ensure your ship doesn't cross the path of the telescopes at any time."

"Tebuteb's Table",
"This world is home to House Garbarag, the Arachi guild of farmers and ranchers. On private ranches far from the cities, they experiment with raising new breeds of longcows, a unique species of cattle that grow a new body segment each year and can reach more than thirty meters in length. The meat from a single longcow can feed a village for a month."

[
"Ternituul",
"Ternituul is a dull world covered in a thick layer of fog hiding a dry desolate surface: an ideal world for the hardened Gegno Vi. A large portion of the Vi's military branch is based here, where new recruits are thrown into the first bottleneck of their lives. It is not uncommon for inhabitants to be lost to the bleak ecosystem of this planet."

"Third Umber",
"This cool, dry world is a sort of natural cleanroom, an ideal place for manufacturing sensitive equipment that could be harmed by the presence of condensation or mildew or pollen granules. The factory workers and overseers live in hive-like dormitories that each house tens of thousands of Kimek."
],
[
"Thornlight",
"A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. The reception area is lavish with several artworks and exotic plants. A well-groomed Hai receptionist informs you that, unless you have family at this respite facility, you will not be permitted to wander the station."

[
"Thule",
"Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own. As such, Thule refused to join the Republic when it was formed, and has since repulsed all efforts to force it to do so. It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed."
],
[
"Thunder",
"When the first colonists landed, they thought that they had found a dream world on Thunder: perfect gravity, perfect temperature, perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, they soon discovered that the planet has unusually high tectonic activity, enough that building anything higher than two stories is almost impossible. Because of the earthquakes, attracting settlers has always been difficult for Thunder, and right now the population is only a few million."

"Tik Klai",
"This world is uncomfortably hot, even for the Wanderers, and so close to its star that the surface is bathed in dangerous levels of ultraviolet light. The few Wanderer installations here are buried underground, with only a few access hatches and storage buildings on the surface."
],
[
"Tinker",
"Tinker is a highly industrialized world, exporting electronics both to the Syndicate and to Earth. The electronic goods manufactured here span the gamut from wires and capacitors to sophisticated microchips, and because many of the jobs here require skilled labor, it is a relatively prosperous planet."

"Topkapi",
"Much like Aksaray, Topkapi is an old moon formed from the smashed remains of countless eons worth of stellar debris. The surface appears to be regularly bombarded by asteroids, although some of the craters show signs of being the site of rather large explosions. Your sensors pick up traces of materials most commonly found in Korath ships."
],
[
"Treser",
"A dark world lies beneath you. Some chemical compound in the clouds is absorbing over ninety percent of the light that hits this planet, resulting in an enormous amount of heat in the gas giant's atmosphere. The extreme temperatures are so taxing on your ship that you are barely able to fly through the uppermost layers. When the heat exceeds a certain point the gas becomes plasma, creating small spots of light on this world of eternal darkness."

"Triton Station",
"Triton Station serves both as a refinery for hyperspace fuel, and as a garrison for ships of the Republic Navy. Patrol ships are constantly landing here and then taking off to scour the surrounding systems for pirates. Since pirates are scarce in this part of space, it seems like a very tedious job."

"Truklar",
"This world, like others the Quarg live on, has noticeably lower gravity than humans are accustomed to. Several medium-sized extravagant villages are found nested deep within an oddly shaped glass structure, and it is a beautiful sight to behold. Many different, smaller biomes also contain wondrous flora and fauna that don't seem to be native to this particular moon. Despite all of this, structures were not built to accommodate visitors such as the nearby aliens, who find it hard to navigate the narrow hallways."

"Tschyss",
"This massive station is the only orbital structure that can be found in Gegno space, and is still under heavy construction. Although a majority of the exterior seems complete, the interior is noticeably lacking in comparison, and it seems that the progress has slowed down significantly in recent times. A large portion of the station is filled with crew quarters and living sections, all more expansive than those in human space, and the outside is enveloped in many docking bays of various sizes."

"Turquoise Four",
"The offshore kelp farms on Turquoise Four produce not only nutritional food, but also an ultra-strong fiber that is used for creating durable textiles. Farther from shore, the Kimek operate fish farms as well. Viewed from above, the ocean surface is divided into patches of deep blue or green or rusty brown depending on what sort of product is being farmed in each patch."

[
"Turra",
"Turra's thick atmosphere makes this gas giant a dark world. From time to time the wall of haze gets broken and a ray of light reveals giant caverns of air within the clouds. The local lifeforms are primitive and mostly plantlike; some of them look like dark flowers, absorbing the little light that shines on them."

[
"Tuur-Aasa-Kaska",
"As it was only very recently settled by the Successors, this large and rocky moon supports only a small population, most of whom are military personnel for the Old Houses and who live underground to avoid the powerful electrical storms on the surface. Though an undeniably hostile and uncomfortable place, the location of its star system has made it an ideal staging point for the fleets of the Old Houses to keep an eye on trade in nearby systems, and the persistent electrical storms on the surface serve to mask the energy signatures of their vessels."
],
[
"Tuur-Oa-Sola",
"The atmosphere of this moon is thin but toxic, and its surface is riddled with fissures that spew hot gases kilometers up into space. It appears to be falling below the Roche limit of the gas giant it orbits, and will probably be torn apart into a ring system within a few thousand years."

"Uye Mpi",
"Spanning lands of dust and bulky rock formations make up a majority of this world's details. However, unlike many other desert worlds, there are many basins of spring water and surprisingly calm weather patterns. The clear blue skies and tame wildlife commonly found on the planet give it a sense of serenity and beauty."

"Vail",
"Vail is an entire world that is maintained as a ski resort for rich clients from the nearby planets. A combination of terraforming and snow making ensures that whichever hemisphere is in winter always has ideal skiing conditions, while farming and other small industries supply the tourists and the large staffs that cater to them."

"Valley of the Damned",
"From afar, this looks like a habitable planet, comfortably located on the near end of the goldilocks zone of its star. It has a high concentration of water vapor in its atmosphere and hosts primitive life, with mosses covering nearly all moist surfaces and exotic crustacean-like animals roaming the land, their carapaces made of what would be considered synthetic plastic elsewhere."
],
[
"Vanikos",
"A young, primordial world, Vanikos is a cold and watery moon still newly formed, with freshwater oceans dominated by strong tides and volcanism. Hydrothermal vents, fueled by the powerful tidal forces acting on the moon, bleed warmth into what are otherwise frigid seas. Life has yet to develop around these temperate islands of heat, but the abundance of water and organic compounds means it is only a matter of time before it takes hold."

[
"Var Oti",
"This rocky world is covered with vast ranges of desert. While some places have plateaus of rugged rock formations, others have articulate valleys of sand. When it comes to less distinct locations, it is hard to tell at first glance whether or not they are simply a formation of rocks resting on a deep layer of sand, or a thin layer of sand resting on a great foundation of rock. In addition, common dust storms constantly reshape the terrain, and together with the harsh, dry conditions, make Var Oti a dangerous world to visitors who are ill-prepared."

[
"Var' Kar'i'i",
"This is a populous Wanderer world, with small farming villages scattered across all the land, and even a few larger population centers that might almost qualify as a city. But from the air, it is not evident at first that the planet is so heavily settled, because the village tree-houses are mostly hidden beneath the forest canopies. The farms, too, are almost indistinguishable from natural land, due to a permaculture system where many varieties of plants are growing side by side."
],
[
"Var' Kayi",
"This is an Earth-like world with one major Wanderer city and countless smaller settlements. The settlements mostly consist of tree-houses built high up in living trees. The architecture of the city skyscrapers is full of cantilevered balconies and arches, mimicking the natural shape of a forest. Here and there a bit of smoke or steam rises from what must be a factory or power plant, but most of the land outside the city is green fields and pristine oceans."

"Var' Roi",
"The surface of this small icy moon is constantly cracked and broken by tidal force from the gas giant that it orbits. The tidal disturbances also heat the moon enough to keep its oceans warm enough to support life despite the small amount of sunlight that reaches here."

[
"Vara K'chrai",
"This is the most populous Wanderer world, with dozens of large cities. The tallest buildings branch and cantilever out from their bases like metallic trees. More than half the surface of the planet is ocean, with a few small settlements built on massive living rafts of algae and seaweed, perhaps ten meters thick and up to several kilometers wide. Much of the land is forests, with villages built entirely in the treetops."

[
"Vara Ke'sok",
"The surface of this world is almost entirely ocean, and the Wanderers who inhabit it live on massive floating algae mats, some of them the size of a small city. Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming."
],
[
"Vara Ke'stai",
"This is a desert world, but the Wanderers are working little by little to make the desert bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes."
],
[
"Vara Kehi'ki",
"This is a farming world, but the primary crops are medicinal plants rather than food: fields of brightly colored flowers and delicate shrubs. Large factories near the farms process the raw plants and extract useful chemical compounds. Their gleaming metal smokestacks belching steam into the air seem incongruous amid the natural beauty and bright colors of the fields of flowers."
],
[
"Vara Pug",
"Vara Pug is an ocean world, wild and almost unsettled, except for a single Pug city on the coast of one of the major continents. The animals and plants on the land are relatively uninteresting, but the oceans are home to an enormous variety of creatures, including whales the size of a Bulk Freighter, a highly intelligent species of jellyfish, and other, far stranger creatures that rarely venture up from the sunless ocean depths."
],
[
"Vara Rakak",
"This is one of those rare worlds whose climate is already nearly perfect without the need for terraforming. The Wanderers have made it into a farming planet. The fields follow the natural contours and geology of the land rather than being laid out in rectangular lots like most human farms, and each field contains several different crop species designed to form a symbiotic ecosystem."
],
[
"Varu Ek'lak'lai",
"The Wanderers harvest metal ores not from planets, but from asteroids, in order to not expend even more of the resources of the planets that are under their care. This star system contains an unusually high concentration of metallic asteroids, and as a result they have built many large refineries here to process the ore that their drones harvest."
],
[
"Varu K'est",
"Varu K'est is a spare, ancient planet of arid plateaus and deep, meandering canyons, with too little rainfall to support any but the hardiest of shrubs. The Wanderers have converted nearly all their villages on this planet into military bases in order to oppose the encroaching Hai raiders, and have also been forced to postpone their attempts at improving the local ecology."
],
[
"Varu K'prai",
"This is one of the only Wanderer worlds that still has large reserves of oil, albeit deep below the ocean surface where mining is difficult. Aside from the drilling companies and refineries, the largest local employer is the local government's safety oversight department, whose inspectors are constantly visiting the drilling platforms and shipping hubs to ensure that all the regulations for preventing oil spills are being followed."
],
[
"Varu Mer'ek",
"This Wanderer factory world is now home to more abandoned villages than populated ones: entire factories rusting and decaying as a result of the recent threat from the Unfettered Hai. Most of the factories that remain active have been repurposed to produce weapons or ammunition for the defense of Wanderer space."
],
[
"Varu Tek'kai",
"This Wanderer world is almost uninhabited and devoid of any indigenous ecosystem, except perhaps on the microscopic level. It has none of the beauty of other Wanderer settlements. Here, factories have been built to process the most dangerous and destructive of industrial chemicals. If disaster strikes one of the factories, the only result will be the contamination of a world that is already dead and lifeless - far better, in the judgment of the Wanderers, than allowing such risky industries to operate on a living world."
],
[
"Varu Tev'kei",
"This is a desert world, too hot and too close to its sun to support much animal or plant life. The Wanderers have covered large stretches of the desert with solar-powered factories: smelters that use the sun's reflected heat to melt ore, and fields of solar panels that support other industries."
],
[
"Vatican",
"Vatican's propensity for constant renewal of the surface has resulted in a flourishing astrogeological academic program. While it has frequently been dismissed as a low priority for Remnant efforts, it has nonetheless received continued support from the defense prefects. Why they would be concerned with the geological formations of an uninhabited planet is unknown, but the research continues."
],
[
"Veiuye",
"Like the other moons of the nearby gas giant, Veiuye is a frozen world. However, the surface layer of Veiyue is rather thin, and more detailed scans show large, hollow caverns beneath the exterior of the moon. These areas are abnormally warm compared to the rest of the moon and appear to be filled with oceans primarily made up of water. Strange readings come from these areas, which could possibly be due to microbial life."
],
[
"Veliante",
"Veliante may have been habitable once, but no longer. Part of its southern hemisphere is filled with deadly levels of radiation, but even elsewhere on the planet, it isn't safe to remain on the surface without adequate protection for too long. While animal life on the planet seems to have disappeared almost completely, plants and trees cover the surface in vast, colorful patches of flora."
],
[
"Vibrant Water",
"Due to strong currents and extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations, the oceans of Vibrant Water are dotted with icebergs that can drift almost as far as the tropics before melting. The largest icebergs are more than a dozen kilometers across and are home to entire ecosystems ranging from ice-dwelling insects to sea birds to large seal-like mammals. Beneath the ocean surface shoals of fish, forests of kelp, and drifting clouds of algae provide a continuous food source for the creatures that inhabit the icebergs."
],
[
"Vigales",
"This hot desert world is home to several species of underground animals. These creatures are very reptile-like, having appearances similar to those of lizards or salamanders from Earth, although much larger in size. It is believed that some indigenous species common across Gegno space originated from this world, or are descendants of ancestral species that once inhabited it."
],
[
"Viminal",
"This cold and dreary world would certainly not be attractive to any modern settlers, but to those who were fleeing the chaos of the Alpha Wars it had the undeniable advantage of being isolated and undiscovered. The continued Remnant presence here is due to the planet's Key Stones, which enable ships to travel through certain wormholes in the Ember Waste, and which the Remnant have not found on any other planet."
],
[
"Vinci",
"Many centuries ago, some of the first settlers on Vinci included a small group of electrical engineers who formed a revolutionary new company for designing computers and microchips. Today, Vinci is the foremost manufacturer of CPUs in all of human space, and their processors are found in everything from navigational computers to video phones to intelligent toasters."

"Violetwake",
"This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone."
],
[
"Viso",
"A world of ice and ammonia, Viso is home to a curious ecosystem of ammonia-breathing bacteria, deep red algae, and small, cold amphibians. The planet's proximity to its host star, a red dwarf, amplifies the interactions between the solar wind and Viso's magnetic field, producing auroras that often reach the equator."
],
[
"Vivid Aether",
"Whether it be from local evolution or panspermia, Vivid Aether's clouds are home to colonies of anaerobic microbial life, feeding on both sunlight and traces of methane in the atmosphere. These form colorful streaks in the upper atmosphere, which were what initially attracted Saryd explorers to the planet. Now, it is common for Heliarch research patrols to sit in orbit for weeks at a time in order to study the simple, yet exotic, ecology. Occasionally, they send down small vessels capable of withstanding the extreme pressures, though none happen to be nearby right now."
],
[
"Vulpa",
"At first sight this planet looks fairly hospitable for a gas giant. The blue tones suggest an ocean world, but looks can be deceiving; its clouds contain countless small glass droplets moving at tremendous speeds, cutting through everything in their way. Your spaceship's hull is able to deflect most of them, but it is advisable not to stay here for too long."
],
[
"Vyraa-Giiq-Sora",
"It's not clear why this planet remains uninhabited, as it possesses a breathable atmosphere and temperate climate; the surface is covered in indigenous lifeforms, many of which exhibit some degree of bioluminescence."
],
[
"Vyraa-Viir-Kella",
"This planet has a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a cool and watery surface with many large lakes. There appear to be no sites of permanent habitation, though a couple of landing pads and associated temporary shelters have been built on islands in the southern hemisphere."
],
[
"Warfeed",
"Warfeed is mostly covered in oceans, and much of its land area devoted to agriculture. Most of the fields are tilled and harvested by robots, but there are also many scattered homesteads of subsistence farmers, who survive with the aid of little or no technology."
],
[
"Warm Slope",
"This is an ideal world, by Saryd standards: rugged, hilly, mostly forested, with oceans and land masses in equal proportions. It serves mostly as a residential world, because this system's heavy industry is focused on the automated factories on its sister world of Ceaseless Toil."
],
[
"Warm Wind",
"The tropical rainforests of Warm Wind are unusual: instead of rivers on the surface, water flows through intricate underground networks of caves that span entire continents. The trees have evolved deep and strong roots that can pierce through the limestone into the subterranean rivers in order to draw a constant supply of water even in the dry seasons. The Saryds have explored only a tiny fraction of the caves."
],
[
"Watcher",
"Watcher is a small moon, the only world in this system that sustains any indigenous life. Because of the low gravity, humans have not yet built a permanent settlement here, but it is occasionally visited by biologists interested in studying low-gravity life forms. There are forests here where the trees grow over two hundred meters tall."
],
[
"Wayfarer",
"Wayfarer was initially settled by a team of scientists and diplomats seeking to build a relationship with the Quarg worlds to the galactic southeast of here. Partly through the aid of the Quarg and partly through a desire to emulate them, it has grown into a very technologically advanced world."
],
[
"Weir of Glubatub",
"The Weir of Glubatub is a quiet ocean world, lit by a dim red sun, whose atmosphere seldom gathers enough energy to spawn storms or other violent weather. Nearly all the life in the oceans is very close to the surface, where the sun's light is bright enough for algae and seaweed to flourish."
],
[
"Weledos",
"Weledos was colonized even before the Avgi evacuated their orbital assets to the Tangled Shroud. A few brave pioneers were willing to settle within the unpredictable systems of the Shroud to escape the planetary governments of Avgi space. They are said to have surveyed and colonized the planet before most explorers had even reached the entrance to the Shroud, surprising early scouts with their presence."
],
[
"Windblain",
"Nearly three quarters of the surface of Windblain is ocean. Most of the industry here centers around petrochemicals: deep sea oil drilling, refining, and manufacture of plastic composites and synthetic fabrics for clothing. There are a few large cities on the continents, but also plenty of wilderness spaces as yet untouched by human activity."
],
[
"Winter",
"The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
],
[
"Wye Tzeou",
"Wye Tzeou is found in a noticeably quiet system. Its surface is covered in extreme crystalline-like structures protruding out in various fashions. These constructs are all exceptionally tall, and no two look alike. It seems the actual surface of the planet is far beneath a layer of these mysterious pillars. There is no obvious environmental reason for this composition as the soft snowy seasons and calm low winds are the most active natural elements on Wye Tzeou."
],
[
"Wyvern Station",
"Wyvern Station was once one of the end destinations for the merchant caravans traveling along the Rim, back in the days before the Republic existed when most systems were not policed and the only way to avoid being plundered by pirates was for ships to travel in large convoys. It has also been a continuously operating hyperspace fuel refinery for more than three centuries."
],
[
"Xerolophos",
"Although formerly classified as a \"Hot Jupiter,\" Xerolophos does not present all the characteristics of one: it is very far from the system star - so distant that it isn't even tidally locked to it. Its temperature, instead, is unusually high even for a Hot Jupiter, with the core internally heating up the atmosphere much more than expected."
],
[
"Xurelei",
"Xurelei's atmosphere is covered with huge tempests that would engulf an Earth-sized planet many times over. Strangely enough, these storms are outwardly much less violent than those recorded from other gas giants, and are easily traversable by probes and other exploration craft. Once below a certain depth, the storms become exponentially more dangerous. The cause of this drastic shift in intensity is unknown."
],
[
"Yedikule",
"Although much smaller than most gaseous planets - including the one it orbits - the thick atmosphere of Yedikule and its rocky core make it a gas dwarf. While it was not the first to be discovered in human history, it is very improbable to have formed around a gas giant, and the extreme differences between its atmosphere and the one of Xerolophos further suggest this was not its original location."
],
[
"Yiddoi",
"Yiddoi appears to be the product of a failed attempt at terraforming predating the Avgi, or one that was abandoned before it was complete. A blend of clearly synthetic reflective compounds was at one point injected into the moon's atmosphere, ostensibly to reduce incoming sunlight and cool its boiling surface."
],
[
"Yiia Iyr",
"Much of Yiia Iyr is obscured by several layers of dark clouds, and what little sunlight makes it to the surface highlights withered plains and dried up riverbeds. Thick layers of fog are often found hugging the ground, and soft, cool air brushes against shrivelling grass fields. There is no discernible cause for why Yiia Iyr appears to be so inhospitable despite having been able to support an ecosystem in the past."
],
[
"Yniu Eiu",
"Yniu Eiu is a rocky world with many canyons. A large portion of the surface is bright shades of gray and white, but the more striking visuals are the patches of purple-red webbed lakes and rivers flowing across the surface. It is unclear if this is a natural occurrence or if these were artificially created, but the way the areas around these sites are dug out and shaped implies that this planet used to be a home to some type of civilization, or one that found importance in this material."
],
[
"Yniu Ena",
"Like its parent planet below, Yniu Ena has a thick purple-reddish web of unnatural material spread across its surface, forming rivers and large lakes. While most of these lakes are rather small relative to the planet's surface, there are a few as large as oceans that give the appearance of scars on the planet."

"Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa",
"Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa's atmosphere is unusually thick for a planet of its size, and contains a very high concentration of carbon monoxide, which, while harmless to the Successors because of their different biochemistry, is highly toxic to humans. The planet supports a rich and biodiverse planetary ecosystem, with large jungles straddling its equatorial regions that give way to strikingly beautiful mountain ranges near the poles."

"Zenith",
"Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it."

"Zug",
"Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture."

"Zydee",
"Although this moon initially seems barren and lifeless, there is evidence that the nearby Gegno Scin have recently attempted to set up an outpost here. Several partially-constructed buildings and landing zones are scattered about the surface, but none of them show any signs of activity, likely due to recent warfare with the Gegno Vi. Despite this, a small number of satellites actively orbit Zydee, likely providing important tactical information such as the volume of system traffic."
